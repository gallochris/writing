  <h1>The Opposite of Blame</h1>

  </header>
				<p>Yesterday I requested an Uber and got much more than a ride home. I learned something.</p>

<p>Andy, my driver, was polite. We talked about his morning. How it was going. Small talk. The weather.</p>

<p>I asked, &ldquo;How do you like working for Uber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy responded and spiraled into a rant about ratings.</p>

<p>He mentions how he received a bad rating from a customer. But the rating wasn&rsquo;t <em>his fault</em>.</p>

<p>He dropped someone off, and they left trash directly behind his seat. Andy couldn&rsquo;t see it, and when he picked up the next person, there was the trash.</p>

<p>The next customer saw the trash, got dropped off, and gave Andy a bad rating because his car was dirty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got a bad rating, and didn&rsquo;t even know why. It wasn&rsquo;t <strong>my fault.</strong> The last person who was in my car left a ton of trash behind my seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s tough.</p>

<hr />

<p>I could relate to Andy. After spending the last few years in the support inbox, I&rsquo;ve wrestled with blame every damn day.</p>

<p>Customers blame you. And it&rsquo;s not your fault they&rsquo;re using Internet Explorer. Or they forgot their password. Or their credit card expired.</p>

<p>You can blame them. It&rsquo;s easy. It takes no effort at all to place blame. None. All you need is a finger to point.</p>

<p>But does that help?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re blaming, you can&rsquo;t change. You&rsquo;re just dependent on the other side. In fact, you&rsquo;re their prisoner.</p>

<p>William Ury, <a href="https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/william-ury">a conversation with Simon Sinek</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blame is placing all the responsibility on someone else. It never helps. Not in any relationship.</p>

<p>Instead of putting the responsibility on someone else. Take it.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s your fault. It means you&rsquo;re part of the problem. You could be a small part of it, but you&rsquo;re in it. Accept that.</p>

<p>Because once you accept that you&rsquo;re part of it, you can change it.</p>

<p>You can ask what version of Internet Explorer they&rsquo;re using or if they can try another browser.</p>

<p>You can send a password reset link or reset the password for them.</p>

<p>Ask if they have a different credit card. Share steps to update their credit card.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can take responsibility. Do it. Because it&rsquo;s contagious.</p>

<p>Once you take responsibility, people are more likely to work with you instead of blame you.</p>

<p><strong>The opposite of blame is taking responsibility.</strong></p>
