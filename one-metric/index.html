  <h1>Is One Number Enough?</h1>

				<p>I have the privilege of speaking with several business owners and marketers each week. These are people devoted to selling more online. One of the most popular questions I receive -</p>

<p><em>What&rsquo;s a good conversion rate?</em></p>

<p>A tough question to answer. It&rsquo;s like asking what&rsquo;s a healthy weight? There is no one size fits all answer. A healthy weight for Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal and Tina Fey is no where near similar. The same is true for business.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>Statistics are used much like a drunk uses a lamppost - for support, not illumination.</p>

<p>Vin Scully</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no silver bullet metric.  One number never tells the whole story. Take a sports and business example.</p>

<hr />

<p>In baseball, people measure everything. If you can record it, then there is a statistic for it. In 2013, UNC left-handed pitcher Tate Parrish appeared in 20 games out of the bullpen - the sixth most on the team. That&rsquo;s 28% of the team&rsquo;s 71 games. It seems like a lot.</p>

<p>But Parrish only threw 6.2 innings. That&rsquo;s all of 20 outs. In comparison, there are 540 outs in 20 games and over 1900 outs in 71 games. While he pitched in 28% of the team&rsquo;s games, he only had a hand in less than 1% of the team&rsquo;s outs.</p>

<p>Because Parrish is a left-handed specialist and often just threw to one batter at a time. The &ldquo;appearances&rdquo; statistic is misleading on its own, but when you added in innings pitched - we can all see clearly now.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two popular online businesses - let&rsquo;s call them Sam&rsquo;s Sandals Shop and Gary&rsquo;s Golf Store.</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s Sandals Shop has a 10% conversion rate. For every 100 visitors, 10 make a purchase. Gary&rsquo;s Golf Store has a 3% conversion rate. For every 100 visitors, 3 make a purchase.</p>

<p>Which business is more successful? 10 is greater than 3. Sam&rsquo;s Sandals Shop is more successful. But that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>

<p>The average order on Sam&rsquo;s Sandals Shop is $5. In this example, he makes $50 off of 10 conversions from 100 visitors. Gary&rsquo;s Golf Store has an average order value of $300. The 3% conversion rate nets Gary $900.</p>

<p>Gary&rsquo;s Golf Store generates 500% more revenue than Sam&rsquo;s Sandals Shop, despite have a conversion rate less than 7%. Conversion rate on its own is not just misleading, it&rsquo;s careless. Because everyone would choose Gary&rsquo;s Golf Store in this scenario.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, what&rsquo;s a good conversion rate? The best answer is a question. Because you can never judge anything off just one metric.</p>

<p>One is the loneliest statistic.</p>
