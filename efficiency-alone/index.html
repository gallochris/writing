				<p>Re-routing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I heard traveling home from the mountains. I knew where I was going. I just got off the interstate and was headed home.</p>
<p>Rather than turn off the Google Maps app, I left it on. And it didn&rsquo;t agree with me.</p>
<p>Re-routing. Five seconds past. Re-routing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if the lady wanted to jump through the phone and say, &ldquo;why are you going this way? It takes twice as long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Re-routing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Straight line. You hear that this is the fastest route between to points. It&rsquo;s the most efficient.</p>
<p>When you drive do you always take the fastest route? The interstate or the highway? Maybe the freeway?</p>
<p>Or do you take the scenic route sometimes? The backroads? Or the &ldquo;long way&rdquo;?</p>
<p>And what route do companies take? You always want them to take the fastest, right?</p>
<p>Instant gratification. You want your item shipped now. The red light to turn green. And a response to your text message immediately.</p>
<p>Efficiency wins. That&rsquo;s what we were taught. Henry Ford once said, &ldquo;efficient industry is the sole key to prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I would say companies that are just transactional, that are at this point just relying on things like efficiency, are probably going to be missing something in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/valerie-coulton">Valerie Coulton</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valerie Coulton is right. Coulton and Alistair Croll <a href="http://tiltthewindmill.com/innovation-culture-and-design-valerie-coulton/">explore the idea</a> of servant leadership and how companies must disrupt themselves. Because efficiency is not the only thing that matters anymore.</p>
<p>Coulton continues, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t somehow feel that they [companies] take some interest in at least your satisfaction or in your comfort, and if not your delight, then I think they&rsquo;re in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="amazon">Amazon</h2>
<p>Amazon breathes efficiency. Fast delivery. One click purchases. Robot run fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>Its built an empire on being efficient. Amazon pays attention to customer service too. It makes clever recommendations for books and keeps you happy with free shipping. Its new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201349900">MayDay button</a> delivers instant face-to-face customer service.</p>
<p>Amazon is a transactional company. It relies on efficiency. Is it in danger?</p>
<p>Kindle Unlimited is a new service from Amazon. You can pay $9.99 a month for all you can read (and listen) books. An interesting approach.</p>
<p>You can try the service for one month free of charge. Why not? Upon signing up for Kindle Unlimited, I received an email that prompted me to get started. With one click, tons of books were at my fingertips.</p>
<p>The choices were dead simple.</p>
<p>Read for free. Buy with 1-Click. Give as a gift.</p>
<p>Efficient.</p>
<p>Kindle Unlimited is a solid service. But after a week passed, and I was still plugging away reading one book, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to worth the $9.99 a month.</p>
<p>It was time to cancel. First, I traveled to Amazon and attempted to cancel my free trial. No dice.</p>
<p>Next, I re-opened the original email and scanned for how to cancel or any information on the free trial. Below is the fine print I found in the email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Kindle Unlimited subscription will continue after your free trial until cancelled. If you do not wish to continue for $9.99/month plus any applicable taxes, you may cancel anytime by visiting Your Account and adjusting your subscription settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I found myself searching for the &ldquo;Your Account&rdquo; section on Amazon. A few more minutes passed. Couldn&rsquo;t find my &ldquo;subscription settings&rdquo; either. Frustrated.</p>
<p>Re-routing.</p>
<p>I headed over to twitter and searched &ldquo;how to cancel Kindle Unlimited&rdquo;. And I found this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/InternetPatrol">@TheInternetPatrol</a>.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.theinternetpatrol.com/how-to-cancel-the-kindle-unlimited-service-on-amazon/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">step-by-step guide</a> to cancel this free trial. That&rsquo;s absurd. A company that turns complicated into simple fails to make it easy to cancel.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s Amazon doing their job. But bullshit. If Amazon can make me buy something in one click and deliver something to me via a drone, why does it take a six step guide to cancel a service?</p>
<p>It feels like Jeff Bezos is just laughing at me. And I&rsquo;m not the only one. Just take a look at the comments of <a href="http://www.theinternetpatrol.com/how-to-cancel-the-kindle-unlimited-service-on-amazon/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">The Internet Patrol guide</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon is not taking any interest in our comfort. It&rsquo;s transactional. Efficient.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t rely on efficiency alone anymore. Amazon is not in immediate danger, but are we starting to <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/losing-amazon-religion/?utm_content=buffer20231&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">lose our religion</a> toward the brand? Time will tell.</p>
<hr>
<p>Re-routing.</p>
<p>I drove all the way home ignoring the lady on Google Maps begging me to go the more efficient route. Because I didn&rsquo;t want to go home the fastest way.</p>
<p>I wanted to drive by my old friend&rsquo;s street that brings back crazy memories. The country roads that make feel comfortable. And the restaurant (Fiesta Grill) that I never go to anymore.</p>
<p>The scenic route is not the most efficient. But sometimes it&rsquo;s the most satisfying.</p>
<p>Companies need to re-route efficiency. And focus on feelings.</p>
