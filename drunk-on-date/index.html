				<p>You can make numbers say whatever you want.</p>

<p>In 2010, I kept score of almost 100 baseball games. As a sports information director at UNC and a press officer for USA Baseball, I saw my fair share of statistics. It&rsquo;s here I learned an important lesson.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Statistics are like a bikini. They show a lot, but still cover up some very vital information.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can measure nearly anything in baseball. Batting average, runs batted in, saves, earned run average, on-base percentage, and more. All for a game as simple as - 1, 2, 3 strikes you&rsquo;re out.</p>

<p>It was a humid April night in Clemson, SC. The Friday night matchup pitted both team&rsquo;s best pitcher against each other. Prior to the game, the opposing radio crew wanted to get my perspective on the UNC starter.</p>

<p>The crew stared at the stats. 4-2 record. Solid strikeout-to-walk ratio. But then they got lost in the numbers.</p>

<p>0-2 in his last 3 starts against ranked teams? One crew member quipped, &ldquo;he struggles against good competition. And our offense is even better than the ranked teams he&rsquo;s faced.&rdquo; Clemson, ranked in the top 25 at the time, featured a player that led the league in home runs.</p>

<p>I could of pulled out more numbers and tried to state my case. A win-loss record of a pitcher is about as meaningful as your fifth grade report card. But all I said was the numbers are misleading in those 3 games.</p>

<p>The crew chuckled and dismissed my comment, hypnotized by the numbers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fast-forward a few years later. I work for an analytics company. We help online businesses measure all aspects of their commerce. I interact with businesses owners and entrepreneurs who rely on these numbers everyday.</p>

<p>Last month, I found myself in an interesting conversation. I began to ask a customer to compare the metrics and data available today to when he first started in e-commerce 15 years ago. I couldn&rsquo;t even finish my sentence, before he cut me off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is so much of it out there today, I feel like I have data coming out of my ears. Data is important, but it can be too much of a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to explain how we&rsquo;ve all fallen in love with data. We measure stuff because we can, not because we should. The numbers drive too many of our decisions.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re data drunks.</p>

<hr />

<p>Back to that muggy April night. The UNC pitcher single-handedly led his team to victory. And 3 years later, <a href="http://www.goheels.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208697160">Matt Harvey</a> was the starting pitcher in the MLB All-Star game.</p>

<p>You could rave about how he shoved a complete-game or struck out 15 batters that night. But as the radio crew that only believed the stats a few hours earlier admitted &hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Numbers won&rsquo;t tell you the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Because numbers can&rsquo;t talk.</em></p>
