				<p>People describe it as sketchy. Ghetto. Lame because you can&rsquo;t even get a mixed drink. The bathrooms are gross. And it smells like urinal cakes inside.</p>

<p>This is a bar in my hometown. And I love it.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://hesnotherenc.com/">He&rsquo;s Not Here</a> is the definition of a dive bar. It&rsquo;s the oldest bar in Chapel Hill, NC for one reason.</p>

<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>

<p>The bar has its own beer garden. It&rsquo;s fantastic on a warm spring day. It attracts all types of people. Even the sketchy ones.</p>

<p>The downstairs is an old automotive garage - and it still feels and smells like it too. Kegs are shoved in a corner.</p>

<p>The bathrooms are disgusting. And the ceiling upstairs is low. When it&rsquo;s packed, you feel like you can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t own a liquor license. It serves just beer and champagne. But there in lies it&rsquo;s focus.</p>

<p>The Blue Cup.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s famous for one item on its menu. A 32 ounce plastic cup that you can fill with beer. There is only one place you can get a Blue Cup. And it&rsquo;s He&rsquo;s Not Here.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you think about focusing, you think focusing is saying yes. Focusing is about saying no. And when you say no, you piss off people.</p>

<p>The result of that focus is really great products. Where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steve Jobs</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s Not Here could have changed. It was <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/storied-bar-hes-not-here-is-for-sale-a-remembrance/Content?oid=2743700">for sale on Craigslist</a> in 2012.</p>

<p>The bar could have added food. Undergone renovations to eliminate the smell. And started to deter the sketchy people who frequented it.</p>

<p>It could have got it&rsquo;s liquor license. They even joked about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Hes_Not_Here/status/451160250201419776">April Fools</a> this year.</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t do any of these things. It&rsquo;s never changed.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>In a town where coffee shops and breweries thrive, the oldest bar remembers when this town was just a village.</p>

<p>Since 1972, He&rsquo;s Not Here has been full of focus.</p>

<hr />

<p>Focus is not about trying hard. Doing more. Or saying yes. It&rsquo;s about saying no. Taking a stand. And having a point of view.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not pissing people off, you&rsquo;re not focusing.</p>
