  <h1>Why Grow?</h1>

				<p>The line was out the door. And stretched down the steps through the parking lot. A bizarre sight. A long line extending outside a small building in the middle of the country on a farm.</p>

<p><a href="http://mapleviewfarm.com/?slide=home">Maple View Farm</a> has been in operation for over 50 years. You can get milk and butter fresh from the farm. And they happen to make delicious ice cream.</p>

<p>Which is the reason all these people, me included, stood in line for over 40 minutes. Just for a cone of Carolina Crunch.</p>

<p>Behind me in line, the question was asked several times. Why don&rsquo;t they open other stores? The line is too long, why not grow?</p>

<hr />

<p>People believe that big is better. We&rsquo;re obsessed with growing and expanding things. Our bank accounts. Our companies. Our customers.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, everything would be bigger. Because bigger is better.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If the world were perfect, it wouldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; - Yogi Berra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scratch your head. But that quote is so true.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Indoor_Stadium">Cameron Indoor Stadium</a> seats less than 10,000 people. It has no air conditioning. It&rsquo;s over 70 years old. Duke has won 4 National Championships while calling Cameron home.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it time Cameron Indoor grow?</p>

<p>If it was any bigger it wouldn&rsquo;t be the home court advantage that it is today. Students wouldn&rsquo;t be able to suffocate the opposing team. And they wouldn&rsquo;t have home winning streaks that span across seasons.</p>

<p>Cameron Indoor Stadium is just the right size.</p>

<hr />

<p>Imagine if you could grow your bank account, company, or customer base double its size tomorrow. Would it be perfect?</p>

<p>Far from it. Because you would have a slew of other challenges and problems. When you obsess over growth, you fail to realize what you have.</p>

<p>And sometimes what you have is just what you need.</p>

<hr />

<p>Maple View Ice Cream opened 2 retail locations in the area a few years ago. They grew. And then they shut both of them down.</p>

<p>Because a line out the door and 40 minute wait is just the right size.</p>
