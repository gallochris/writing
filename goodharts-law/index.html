				<blockquote>
<p>To simplify the world enough that it can be captured with numbers means throwing away a lot of detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/29/what-data-cant-do">article</a> by Hannah Fry in th New Yorker is a fascinating look at the limitations of data.</p>
<p>The devil is in the details.</p>
<p>Numbers are sterile. There is little color and taste. Context is removed.</p>
<p>After all, there is Goodhart&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>The law states <strong>when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</strong></p>
<p>The law leads to unintended consequences or when an attempted solution to a problem, makes the problem even worse. This is often known as the <a href="https://sketchplanations.com/the-cobra-effect">cobra effect</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capital of Colombia, Bogotá, tried to reduce traffic congestion by restricting each car from <em>driving one day</em> during the week. The result: people started buying more than 1 car and did more driving on weekends, thus increasing traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is incentives work too well. Humans are terrific at manipulation.</p>

<p>Remember, numbers never tell you the whole story.</p>
