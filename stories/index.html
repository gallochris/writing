				<p>Communication is all about story telling. Everyone can think of a good story.</p>
<p>But what are the elements of a good story?</p>
<p>Two tools that I&rsquo;ve found recently:</p>
<ol>
<li>SCQA (Situation, Complication, Questions, Answer)</li>
<li>Nonviolent Communication</li>
</ol>
<p>These two tools might feel completely different, however, I&rsquo;ve found a lot of similarities.</p>
<h2 id="nonviolent-communication">Nonviolent Communication</h2>
<p>Non-violent communication is a helpful way to build better relationships. Think of it as a tool to help you communicate with your partner and resolve conflict.</p>
<p>It has the following fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact (make an observation)</li>
<li>Feeling (state how you feel, typically this is one word)</li>
<li>Needs</li>
<li>Specific Request</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good and Bad Examples</strong></p>
<p>First, the bad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your room is a mess. It&rsquo;s so annoying, why can&rsquo;t you always keep it clean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is using evaluations. It&rsquo;s making the receiver of this information feel wrong or bad.</p>
<p>Now, the good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your bed is unmade, there are dirty clothes on the floor, and you have a pile of trash in the corner. I&rsquo;m feeling annoyed because keeping the house clean is important to me. Would you be willing to spend 20 minutes and take out the trash and put away the dirty clothes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This states observable facts. It shares <em>why</em> the mess is bothersome. A clean house is a need. It makes a specific request to try and resolve the conflict.</p>
<h2 id="scqa">SCQA</h2>
<p>In the same way nonviolent communication has four components, so does SCQA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation</li>
<li>Complication (the problem and its cause)</li>
<li>Questions</li>
<li>Answers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example (modified from <a href="https://analytic-storytelling.com/scqa-what-is-it-how-does-it-work-and-how-can-it-help-me/">here</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Situation: People who are injured often need to do physical therapy to recover. This includes doing exercises at home.</p>
<p>Complication: Around 70% of people do not do exercises at home. This is why they recover more slowly or not all. These people lack the motivation to do it on their own.</p>
<p>Question: How can you motivate people to do physical therapy exercises at home?</p>
<p>Answer: Gamification. A webcam feeds the patient’s movements to a video game. This means the patients recover faster because they&rsquo;re motivated and engaged.</p>
<h2 id="tying-it-all-together">Tying it all together</h2>
<p>When we compare each component, we discover the similarites.</p>
<ul>
<li>State an observable fact <em>or</em> describe the situation.</li>
<li>Share how you feel <em>or</em> define the problem.</li>
<li>State your unmet need <em>or</em> ask how can we overcome the problem.</li>
<li>Make a specific request <em>or</em> share what action will resolve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these tools can help shape a <em>better</em> story. A story that is well-defined and cohesive.</p>
<p>Because we all have a story to tell, why not make it a good one?</p>
