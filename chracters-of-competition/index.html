<blockquote>
<p>Your competitor tomorrow may be completely different from your competitor today. It’s out of your control. What’s the point of worrying about things you can’t control?</p>

<p>Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, <a href="https://itun.es/us/4Lfgz.l">Rework</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Competition is all around you. A competitor might be a company in your industry, your favorite sports team&rsquo;s rival, or the candidate that applies from the same job as you. But there are far more characters of competition than competitors.</p>

<p>Characters of competition are hidden. Take these 3 examples.</p>

<h2 id="1-losing-a-sale-to-a-competitor">1. Losing a sale to a &ldquo;competitor&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Two companies could offer the same solution. Let&rsquo;s go with IBM and Apple. Both sell computers. The consumer, named Carl, buys an IBM. Apple could obsess over the loss an attribute it to IBM building a better computer.</p>

<p>However, Carl didn&rsquo;t buy an IBM because it was a better computer. Carl just got laid off from his job and needs to support his family. The MacIntosh computer is priced higher than IBM. The character of competition is Carl&rsquo;s budget - not that IBM is better at building computers.</p>

<h2 id="2-your-favorite-team-loses-a-recruit-to-your-rival">2. Your Favorite Team Loses a Recruit to Your Rival</h2>

<p>You love UNC basketball. But the top recruit in the nation, Wally Pipp, just signed a letter of intent with your hated rival Duke. Duke must be the better program, have the better coach, and be the better team in a year.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the case. Wally Pipp did not choose Duke because its better than UNC. He chose Duke because a returning player, that plays his position, broke his ankle and is out for all of next season. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to do with coach, program, or academics. Playing time is lead role in the competition for the recruit. And it just so happens it lies with Duke.</p>

<h2 id="3-you-lost-the-job-to-a-more-experienced-candidate">3. You Lost the Job to a More Experienced Candidate</h2>

<p>It must be the experience. John has 6 years experience, and you own 4. If you had more experience, you would of gotten the gig. But that&rsquo;s not why you lost the job.</p>

<p>John is the brother in-law of the hiring manager. John is familiar, and it&rsquo;s why he was chosen for the job. The hiring manager delivered a favor and hired John. And not you.</p>

<p>You weren&rsquo;t competing against John. You were competing against familiarity. This character of competition is undefeated. Because it&rsquo;s not what you know, it&rsquo;s who you know.</p>

<hr />

<p>Notice in these 3 examples - all could obsess over the competitor. But it&rsquo;s never worth it.</p>

<p>Because the characters of competition change everyday. Your competitor tomorrow is not your competitor today.</p>
