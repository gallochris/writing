You are not *what* you do. 

What you are is *how* you do it. 

I've been chewing on this idea for awhile. 

Maybe forever? 

I've always believed the *context* of any situation is more important. 

That perception *isn't really reality*. 

That the grass *isn't always greener on the other side*.

* * * 

So what's the *what*? 

The *what* is the result. 

It's the outcome. 

The *what* is the effect. 

It's the conclusion. 

Aftermath. 

The *what* doesn't tell a story. 

Only an ending. 

* * * 

And the *how*?

The *how* is the process. 

The technique. 

The *how* explains the cause. 

Not the effect. 

It's the juicy details. 

The *how* is the method. 

Not the madness. 

The *how* tells the story. 

The plot. 

* * * 

Be skeptical of the *what*. 

And curious of the *how*. 

Because you are not *what* you do. 

What you are is *how* you do it.
