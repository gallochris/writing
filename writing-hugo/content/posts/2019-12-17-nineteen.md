As 2019 comes to an end, here are 19 things I learned in the year 2019.  

1. A seed has to completely destroy itself to become a flower. 

2. Stretch.

3. Read. Exercise. Breathe. 

4. If you don't understand something or can't explain it, find the extremes to get a clear picture. 

5. Intelligence beats experience. 

6. Clear your mind of old ideas. 

7. Before you have an opinion, try to support it with data or insight/experience. 

8. You don't need to like change, but you must adapt to change. 

9. Because the only constant is often change. 

10. The best gift you can give your family is time *together*. 

11. Reading and research is the best antidote to boredom. 

12. Three F's of decisions: firm, fair, and fast. 

13. Say *how* you feel before *why* you feel that way. 

14. You're awful at estimating how long it takes to do something you've never done before. Just start. Just do it. 

15. Ask what you're not taking into account. 

16. Teach by using examples. Not descriptions. 

17. Treat your body like your dog. 

18. If you drink too much water, you'll drown. Keep some mystery about you. 

19. You would rather be good than known.
