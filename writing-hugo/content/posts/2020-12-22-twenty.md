As 2020 comes to an end, here are a few things I learned in the year 2020.   

1. The easiest way to gain happiness is to want the things you already have.

2. Pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover your mistakes.

3. Want only those things that are easy to obtain. Want only those things you can be certain of obtaining.

4. To know how many are jealous of you, count your admirers.

5. What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about these things.

6. Always or never are the real bad words. 

7. Being too prepared can be unhealthy.

8. It’s always difficult until it gets easy. 

9. When you’re stressed, it’s probably because you don’t agree with reality and who’s problem is that? 

10. Try not having expectations. 

11. Think positive, plan negative. 

12. Don’t confuse the destination with the route. 

13. Your reaction to a bad outcome can make things worse. 

14. Insurance is a classic example of a hedge. 

15. You notice bad luck but overlook dumb luck.

16. Experience is necessary for learning, but individual experiences often interfere with learning. 

17. Don’t overlook the value in being a little less wrong or a little closer to right.

18. If you don’t ask a question, you won’t get an answer. 

19. The person you’re most likely to mislead is yourself. 

20. Increasing accuracy costs time. Saving time costs accuracy.
