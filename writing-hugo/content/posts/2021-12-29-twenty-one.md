As 2021 comes to an end, here are a few things I learned in the year 2021.   

 1. The marginal return of working harder is negative.

 2. Burnout is not a badge of honor. 
 
 3. Burnout means you’ve lost a sense of what is important.

 4. If you try to do too much too fast, you can’t sustain any momentum.
 
 5. Aim for residual results, not just linear. 
 
 6. In order to achieve, you must not overdo. 
 
 7. When you focus on what you lack, you lose what you have.
 
 8. When you focus on what you have, you get what you lack.
 
 9. Do not do more today than you can recover from tomorrow.
 
 10. Clearing clutter in your physical environment helps clear your brain.
 
 11. Ask what is the first obvious step, and  start there. 
 
 12. Create ranges - I will never do less than X, or more than Y.
 
 13. Be employable by using the three I’s - integrity, intelligence, initiative.
 
 14. Don’t manage the problem, solve it before it happens.
 
 15. Facts, feelings, why, and make a request is how to communicate non-violently.
 
 16. No matter what happens, you’re responsible for how you feel 99% of the time.
 
 17. A problem is a difference between things as desired and things as perceived.
 
 18. We never have enough time to do it right, but we always have enough time to do it over.
 
 19. We never have enough time to consider if we want it, but we always have enough time to regret it.
 
 20. The fish is always the last to see the water.
 
 21. Don’t rush in with a solution before you define the problem.
