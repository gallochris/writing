This an attempt to try something new this year. Publish a few goals and check back at the end of 2022.

## Run no less than 15 miles and no more than 25 miles in a week

The stretch goal here is to reach 1,000 miles run by the end of the year. This does not include walks, only runs. 

It could be five or more 5Ks in a week, or maybe two 10Ks and a 5K. This feels doable. 

## Read at least one book and no more than three books every three months

This feels like a low bar. It also feels like it can be done. Whether it's four books or 12 by the end of the year, this feels like a sustainable goal. 

A non-zero day or reading at least one page a day is important. 

## Write and share code snippets at least once a week

I _can_ write code. Ruby and R. The problem is my discipline. 

In order to learn more, I want to share code either via a blog or GitHub gists.
