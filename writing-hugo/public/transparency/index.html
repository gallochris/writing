  <h1>A Few Words About Transparency</h1>

				<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t even the rental application,&rdquo; she confessed.</p>
<p>I contended, &ldquo;40 minutes late, and didn&rsquo;t even give us the right information. Wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is perfect, though. It&rsquo;s exactly what we both want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p>The place was a one bedroom condo in Arlington, VA in a brand new building. It&rsquo;s across from a grocery store. Within steps to several restaurants. Spacious. And for a solid price.</p>
<p>An hour earlier, we saw a basement apartment. It&rsquo;s a small, segmented space. The fridge, toilet, and window are so close you could a run a triple-option. No chance our furniture could fit.</p>
<p>The places were different. And so were the people behind them. The first is managed by a large, real-estate company. The apartment was an old nanny&rsquo;s suite in the basement of someone&rsquo;s home. It was part of her house.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I needed to make a decision where to live.</p>
<p>Which place did we choose?</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a lot of noise around the word transparency. It&rsquo;s become a <a href="http://adage.com/article/the-media-guy/media-marketing-buzzwords-die/294521/">buzzword</a>. Companies tout, &ldquo;we value transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what does transparency really mean?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>transparent (adj.) -  easy to see through, understand, or recognize; obvious; open; frank; candid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do what you say. Share what you know. Tell the truth.</p>
<p>That is transparent.</p>
<p>Our generation believes in it. We are used to sharing everything. And we want the companies we deal with to do the same.</p>
<p>If there is a lack of information, we assume you&rsquo;re hiding something from us. We tell people what we think - good or bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to be adopted in business too. Buffer is a young company that is an open-book. Buffer shares financials, employee&rsquo;s <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/">salaries</a>, and even their <a href="http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/inline/2013/05/3009585-inline-inline-1-7-slightly-crazy-ways-to-build-a-happy-productive-and-transparent-company.jpg">sleep cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<hr>
<p>People buy from other people for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>They know you.</li>
<li>They like you.</li>
<li>They <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can spend money for people to know you. Companies buy attention all the time. Advertising?</p>
<p>You can be funny and generous to get people to like you. If we get <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bradfrostweb/death-to-bullshit/67">1,000 likes</a> on Facebook we&rsquo;ll donate to an orphanage. Lame.</p>
<p>How do you get people to trust you?</p>
<p>Make the other person feel important - and do so sincerely. Try honestly to see things from the other person&rsquo;s point of view. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.</p>
<p>Do what you say. Share what you know. Tell the truth.</p>
<p>Be transparent. And you&rsquo;ll earn people&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>For example, when your company is hacked and the personal information of your customers is comprised, it can shatter trust. That didn&rsquo;t happen to Buffer.</p>
<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20240?token=zZuphi4EVlUOd0QS1a2aJoRnBpzRAeyT4RvQfPN8Z-8YYktOAPiCpRCIAwr17qFz_lWud6hgM0Vzr06ToEtj7qg" alt="bufferapp-transparency.png"></p>
<p>Because Buffer does what it says its going to do. They share what they know. And tell the truth.</p>
<p>Sure, Buffer lost customers. But several people stuck with them because they trust Buffer. The young company continues to grow, nearing $4 million dollars in revenue a year.</p>
<hr>
<p>People share their money with other people they trust.</p>
<p>Jason Fried and Jeffrey Zeldman explore this topic on <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/07/01/37signals-jason-fried-live-today-on-the-big-web-show/">The Big Web Show Podcast</a>. Jason shares a story about shopping for a car. He had a choice of where to buy the car.</p>
<p>He could pick a local dealer that could give him the car instantly. But that dealer&rsquo;s salesman rubbed him the wrong way. He didn&rsquo;t treat him well.</p>
<p>Or he could wait 30 days, and buy from a dealer in Chattanooga, TN. This car salesman was smart, informative, and made Jason feel important.</p>
<p>So which car did he buy?</p>
<p>Jason explains how someone told him something that completely changed his perspective on money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every dollar is a vote. And when you spend your dollars, you&rsquo;re voting for the things that you want to see more of.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Fried</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jason waited 30 days and bought the car from the dealer in Chattanooga. Because he wants more people like that salesman in the world. He voted for him.</p>
<p><em>Trust.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So which place did we choose to live?</p>
<p>It turns out the real estate company was shady. Shenanigans. Hidden application and move-in fees. Two people gave us two different answers about how much parking cost. Terrible reviews.</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>After visiting the basement apartment, we exchanged emails with the owner of the home. She asked more questions about us - as people. She shared places to eat in the area. And more about herself.</p>
<p>She was transparent. And she got our vote.</p>
