<p>Experience separates the old from the young. The good from the bad. The disciplined from the reckless.</p>

<p>But how do you get experience?</p>

<hr />

<p>I remember asking myself this question. Like a lot of my peers, I lost out on several jobs because of one thing. Experience.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a deflating cycle. Why do you need experience to get experience? If you had experience, you wouldn&rsquo;t need experience.</p>

<p>The truth is experience is all around you. It comes from the most unlikely places. You just have to open your eyes and embrace it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Don&rsquo;t just do whatever makes you happy. That is empty advice. Max Temkin and the founders of Cards Against Humanity shared their values and beliefs. Be funny and stay independent.</p>

<p>Temkin&rsquo;s business experience prior to building a best-selling board game? A summer at Radioshack. Now he shares his <a href="http://blog.maxistentialism.com/post/47207276845/kickstarter">experiences</a> with others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We had no idea what we were doing, but we had vision and values.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gary Vaynerchuk is a salesman. He&rsquo;s built a multi-million dollar wine business, wrote best-selling books, and now runs a successful creative agency. Before all that, he came from zero.</p>

<p>He went from selling baseball cards to selling wine. Because he connected the dots of his past experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank Thomas, Ken Griffey Jr., Wayne Gretzky. Silver Oak, Caymus, Chateau Lafite. Same shit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis C.K. started doing standup in 1984. As a writer on the Conan O&rsquo;Brien Show, he once played a tree in a sketch. He didn&rsquo;t all of sudden become great.</p>

<p>It took patience and persistence to win Emmys. It took doing things for free. It took experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A 55 year old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28 year old with 3 PHDs. Especially smarter than him. The garbage man is 55. He has <em>experience</em>. Things have happened to him.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>If you want more experience, share what you believe. Try new things. Volunteer. Work for nothing. Be patient. Ask for help.</p>

<p>Experience.</p>
