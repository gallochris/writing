				<p>About a year ago, I <a href="https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/goals-2022/">published a few different goals</a>.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to grade how I did on those goals, and add a few ideas headed into 2023.</p>
<h2 id="run-no-less-than-15-miles-and-no-more-than-25-miles-in-a-week">Run no less than 15 miles and no more than 25 miles in a week</h2>
<p>Completed. I ran just over 1,000 miles in 2022 or about 20 miles per week.</p>
<p>The Elizabeth 8K race at the end of April was a big help. The race is around five miles and my goal was to run it in under 38 minutes. I met that goal and <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/en-US/results/detail/us3su7mgvvhy57qn">finished</a> in around 36 minutes.</p>
<p>I did find as the year went on, this became harder for me to get motivated. I fell in November and this slowed my progress. It was not pleasant, but I was able to power through.</p>
<p>The lack of running or being outside increased my anxiety a ton. It was really important for me to get back out there, even if I was moving super slow.</p>
<h2 id="read-at-least-one-book-and-no-more-than-three-books-every-three-months">Read at least one book and no more than three books every three months</h2>
<p>Incomplete or failed.</p>
<p>I finished only one book - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dilla-Time-Afterlife-Producer-Reinvented/dp/0374139946">Dilla Time</a>, an awesome book about legendary producer J Dilla.</p>
<p>I was not disciplined enough to meet this goal. The transition in working from home with a newborn has been rough. Any free time is not spent reading a book right now. There is little silence.</p>
<p>I tried audio books, but couldn&rsquo;t get into it. I tried books around work or product management, and it was awful. It felt overwhelming. I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to meet this one in the future.</p>
<h2 id="write-and-share-code-snippets-at-least-once-a-week">Write and share code snippets at least once a week</h2>
<p>Compelted.</p>
<p>I took a course, R for the rest of us, and it was a huge help to push me out of my comfort zone. I learned a good amount and decided to publish a <a href="https://blessyourchart.substack.com/">weekly newsletter</a> in 500 words or less with at one data visualization about Carolina sports. I&rsquo;m sharing the code <a href="https://cjg.quarto.pub/bless-your-chart/">here</a>.</p>
<p>R is super powerful, and I hope to continue writing more code in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>2023 is here. The past year has felt like 10 minutes and 10 years at the same time.</p>
<p>This year, I&rsquo;m trying to operate in shorter time frames. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot can change in 12 months. It feels almost too long to set a goal, so I&rsquo;m going to try to make progress one month at a time.</p>
<p>Two ideas so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run 20 days in the month of January. The hint here is I ran 230 days in 2022. The goal is to increase that to 250. Even if it&rsquo;s one mile or nine miles.</li>
<li>Share code once a week and publish the newsletter. This is a way for me to continue practicing and learning R. I&rsquo;m not sure if the newsletter makes it to the end of the year, but this month feels doable.</li>
</ol>
