  <h1>Cut it in Half</h1>

				<p>This week my workout was cut in half. Instead of 32 laps in the pool, it&rsquo;s now just 16.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a major adjustment. One that is feels twice as hard. It&rsquo;s funny - how can you cut something in half and it be twice as hard?</p>
<hr>
<p>As humans, we&rsquo;re not afraid to use words. Jargon. Buzzwords. Run-on sentences. Big words. Words with no meaning.</p>
<p>Schools train students that length is important. Five paragraph essays. 10 or 20 page papers. If you fill up a whole blue book, you feel more accomplished than if you just wrote one page. More is better.</p>
<p>Why? It&rsquo;s easy to write more. To use fluff and ramble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to make every word count. To save space <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/1539-writing-decisions-saving-space-without-losing-meaning">without losing meaning</a>. It&rsquo;s hard to write with focus.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example - let&rsquo;s look at 2 different email service providers. MailChimp and Constant Contact.</p>
<p>Lots of software companies fail to explain what they <em>actually</em> do. In this example, just take a look at homepage of each company.</p>
<p><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/coxvusqpxcvxq_small.jpg" alt="mc-v-cc.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> uses three words. <em>Send better email.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/overview-home?s_tnt=56380:4:0">Constant Contact</a> goes for a 13 word explanation. <em>Successful marketing starts here. Bring your marketing together with the Constant Contact toolkit.</em></p>
<p>Which is more clear? MailChimp explains exactly what you do with their software. It&rsquo;s dead simple. So simple even my mom uses it - not kidding.</p>
<p>Constant Contact leaves you wondering what&rsquo;s in their toolkit. The word marketing is redundant. This is where it starts? And it comes together? It sounds confusing.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean MailChimp is automatically better than Constant Contact. Or you shouldn&rsquo;t do business with Constant Contact. It just illustrates the importance of a simple message.</p>
<p>If it were easy to write less more people would do it. We wouldn&rsquo;t have sentences like <em>&ldquo;We bring innovation to strategy through Strategic Interrogation, Engineered Creativity and Directed Research&rdquo; - via <a href="http://designjargonbullshit.com/">designjargonbullshit.com</a></em>. More words might sound elegant to you, but it just makes other people scratch their head.</p>
<p>Suck it up. Write short. Use small words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few good words can be worth a thousand pictures.</p>

<p>The pool switched to a long course. Instead of 25 meters, it&rsquo;s now 50 meters. The 16 laps are the same distance as the 32 laps.</p>
<p>My workout didn&rsquo;t lose any purpose when you cut it in half.</p>
<p><em>It got better.</em></p>
