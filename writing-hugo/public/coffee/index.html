				<p>Customers do not have problems. They only struggle to make progress.</p>
<p>People buy products or services to get a <em>job</em> done. This is known as jobs to be theory coined by Clayton Christensen.</p>
<p>After reading [Competing Against Luck]https://books.hotdogsandeggs.com/competingagainstluck/), this theory has hit me over the head recently while consuming one of my favorite things.</p>
<p>Coffee.</p>
<p>Here are some of the different options I have to get my fix of coffee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemex</li>
<li>Nespresso</li>
<li>Cometeer</li>
<li>French Press</li>
<li>Buy it from a cafe</li>
</ul>
<p>My wife and I have purchased several items that all fulfill one job. Make coffee.</p>
<p>The latest one we&rsquo;ve tried is called <a href="https://cometeer.com/">Cometeer</a>. It&rsquo;s marketed as flash-frozen instant coffee.</p>
<p>A box of frozen pods/pucks arrive on dry ice to your door. When you&rsquo;re ready for a cup of coffee, you just add boiling water or add it to an iced drink.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple process that eliminate several steps.</p>
<p>Cometeer has taught me about <em>situation and circumstance</em> when it comes to why you purchase or buy something.</p>
<p>The product is not the right choice for every scenario when I need a cup of coffee. I likely wouldn&rsquo;t use several pods if I was making coffee for guests or multiple people.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m in a rush, just adding hot water to a frozen pod is progress for me. Fast progress.</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember something that’s well designed for one situation can be a total failure in others.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t wear roller blades in a foot race on grass.</p>
<p>The context of the situation matters a lot when determing <em>why</em> someone purchases a product or uses a service.</p>
