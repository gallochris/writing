  <h1>Marginal Thinking</h1>
  <p class="jangell">This post will take you about <span class="readtime">
1 minute</span> to read.</p>
  <hr class="tothetop">

				<p>The consequence of action. Every decision has consequences.</p>
<p>Bad decision. Worse consequences.</p>
<p>Good decision. Better consequences.</p>
<p>The tricky part is most of the time the consequences are hidden.</p>
<p>If you run a red light, and nothing happens, you don&rsquo;t always <em>feel</em> like you made a poor choice.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If you give in to “just this once,” based on a marginal-cost analysis, you’ll regret where you end up. That’s the lesson I learned: It’s easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time. The boundary — your personal moral line — is powerful, because you don’t cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there’s nothing to stop you doing it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clayton Christensen explains marginal thinking in his book <em>How Will You Measure Your Life</em> and it feels important today.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you keep running red lights, eventually something will happen.</p>
<p>Because change is constant.</p>
<p>The future is <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>And the <em>full cost</em> of your decision will arrive some day.</p>
<p>Marginal thinking is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been more important to decide what you stand for, and stand for it all the time.</p>
