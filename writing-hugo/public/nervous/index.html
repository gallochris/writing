				<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to be nervous, it means your alive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The advice you receive from your parents is endless. Be safe. Take care of yourself. Sit up straight.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re rarely ready to learn at the same time your parents are ready to teach you. The advice falls on deaf ears. You don&rsquo;t even hear it.</p>

<p>Then one day, you start believing it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I used to get terribly nervous before rec league basketball games. I felt like I was a 10 year old kid getting ready to go play Michael Jordan in front of thousands of people. I thought the nerves meant I was just afraid.</p>

<p>It means your alive, my mother would say. It was comforting, but I really didn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>

<p>Until, I believed it.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you&rsquo;re getting ready for a job interview, a date, a cold call, a game - you get nervous. You think about all the ways you could fail. Instead of using that energy to your advantage.</p>

<p>Learning to sell yourself or your ideas is not easy. And a major obstacle is overcoming your nerves. But you will continue to fail, if you let your nervous feeling take over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone gets nervous. Everyone. If they say they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re either lying or they&rsquo;re sociopaths. The trick is to use the nerves to trigger adrenaline. Let them lift you up to a higher level. A better you.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your body reacts the same when you&rsquo;re nervous <em>and</em> excited. It&rsquo;s simple. If you&rsquo;re nervous, tell yourself you are excited. And then use that excitement to perform.</p>

<p>Because Mom was right after all.</p>

<p>Feeling nervous? It just means your alive.</p>
