				<p>Does anyone like waiting in line?</p>
<p>There is someone in front you and someone behind you. You&rsquo;re stuck.</p>
<p>I remember standing in line at Time Warner Cable one Saturday morning to return equipment. I was there for an hour and a half with other brave souls.</p>
<p>Ninety-two. Time Warner Cable literally passed out numbers. That&rsquo;s a terrible way to make people feel.</p>
<hr>
<p>A lot of us often forget to be human today. We&rsquo;re on our gadgets all day. We interact with screens more than we do with other people.</p>
<p>A few days ago I went to search for a flight. There&rsquo;s tons of choices to book travel. I settled on an app my brother told me to check out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a>.</p>
<p>Why did he tell me about Hipmunk?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compare flights, cheap prices with easy connections too. And they have this funny looking mascot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mascot? What does that have to do with me finding a flight?</p>
<p>Whenever you search for a flight, you&rsquo;ll land on a loading screen as Hipmunk is pulling all the data from different airlines together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in line waiting your turn to see available flights. Hipmunk could present a simple progress bar that alerts you to be patient. But that would make you feel kind of like a number. It&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>Instead here&rsquo;s the screen you see.</p>
<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/21124?token=9Q_uElI5D8R9lW4Sd7qmltBSerG0d3o7isFYAquJbq7jIRMthuSJnLVsxezidxxZzt8kmgLwMOrz8G3gkJEPqAs" alt="hipmunk-mascot.gif"></p>
<p>That makes me smile. Every single time. It never fails.</p>
<p>The same is true for their mobile app. Here&rsquo;s the screen you see on your mobile device.</p>
<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/21126?token=f_IFLKylXo6ndrwY-Fryjz8F2Vt0I4BU5N3ZAqGbdYJ58pRWwAAVlRbj2D_nektIi-qAVV8Q6i3CVTGm3wNXt20" alt="hipmunk-mobile-mascot.jpg"></p>
<p>The same mascot plus a proverb from Tzu. There&rsquo;s no boring progress bar that&rsquo;s like watching grass grow or paint dry. This mascot makes you feel human.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People are interacting with our products in most cases with a computer or some handheld device that isn&rsquo;t very human at all. Like it&rsquo;s a robot at the end of the day. And any opportunity to remind them that they&rsquo;re are human beings working on this thing to make this kind of human connection is one that you have to seize.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a number. Or a robot. You&rsquo;re a person.</p>
<p>Look for opportunities to remind yourself and others around you that we&rsquo;re all just human beings.</p>
