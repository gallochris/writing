				<p>How do you get good at jumping rope?</p>
<p>No one is born knowing how to jump rope.</p>
<p>So, how do you get good at it?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing how to do something and doing it are two different things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to go all Yoda, but there is so much truth in that quote. Whenever learning something new, you have to <em>do</em> and not just <em>know</em> or <em>say</em>.</p>
<p>In the past several months, I&rsquo;ve built a tiny web application using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">statistical programming language R</a>. Using the Shiny package, I built an app with data complied of every North Carolina men&rsquo;s basketball box score since the 2003-04 season.</p>
<p>You can find the app here: <a href="https://app.dadgumboxscores.com/">app.dadgumboxscores.com</a></p>
<p>This was the most challenging technical exercise I&rsquo;ve ever done. I knew almost nothing about R.</p>
<p>I signed up for courses, watched YouTube videos, read blogs, tried reading a book too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so green when it comes to this language, I don&rsquo;t even know what to search for to try to get help at times. The terminology was foreign. It&rsquo;s a brand new language.</p>
<p>So, I kept trying things. This resulted in silly mistakes. Frustration. Four letter words.</p>
<p>And a whole lot of progress.</p>
<p>The app is hosted using Amazon Web Services on its own server. I know what that means, but the fact I was able to somehow set that up on my own is bonkers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rewarding when you&rsquo;re able to build something or surprise yourself.</p>
<p>The app is far from perfect. It works. And that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuck around with it a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our exercise coach said when asked about how to get good at jumping rope.</p>
<p>Practice.</p>
<p>Try things.</p>
<p>Because there is a difference between knowing <em>how</em> to do something and <em>doing</em> it.</p>
