  <h1>Most Overlooked Part of Remote Work</h1>

				<p>Remote work has never been more en vogue.</p>
<p>A global pandemic means now almost everyone has experience working from home.</p>
<p>There used deep resistance to remote work in the past. There is no substitute for meeting in person. Face-to-face communication is crucial. If you let employees work from home, how you will you know that they&rsquo;re actually working?</p>
<p>The pandemic cuts through all of that because there isn&rsquo;t much of an alternative.</p>
<p>Remote work is a more or less a requirement for me and my career in the future. I believe in it, and value it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked remotely since 2014.</p>
<p>There are lots of perks.</p>
<p>No commute. No dress code. More time with family. More flexibility to complete work on your own time. A pet as your co-worker.</p>
<p>I remember when I first start working remotely, I loved the fact that I felt like I <em>actually</em> had time to do laundry.</p>
<p>But over time, I <em>think</em> there is one aspect a lot of us ignore when it comes to remote work.</p>
<p>The people.</p>
<p>In my experience, I&rsquo;ve worked with a ton of brilliant people. These people live in different areas of the country or they live in completely different countries.</p>
<p>These people have different beliefs, ways to communicate, and unique talents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident there is no way I would have met similar people, if where I worked, everyone was from the same town.</p>
<p>When you get to work with people from all over, it changes your perspective on many things. It makes <em>you</em> a better person because it forces you to actually work with people that are not like you.</p>
<p>It makes you more aware of the differences in people.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re all human beings.</p>
<p>The next time someone asks why you prefer remote work or you interview for a remote job, consider the opportunity it brings to meet people not like you and the upside of that opportunity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s invaluable.</p>
