  <h1>Get a Goat</h1>

<p>You&rsquo;re a negative piece of shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My old boss told me this once. And it stung.</p>
<p>Still stings.</p>
<p>But he was right. Not 100% right. Nothing really is <em>that</em> black and white.</p>
<p>But he was right.</p>
<p>Maybe 70% right.</p>
<hr>
<p>My father was a baseball coach growing up. And not little league.</p>
<p>He coached collegiate teams and summer league teams. Cape Cod. Those players are the opposite of little.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re big. Future major leaguers like Greg Vaughn, Will Clark, and Joe Girardi.</p>
<p>There is an old plack in our house with a newspaper article about my father and his coaching colleague.</p>
<p>The article is titled <em>Doom and Gloom</em></p>
<p>Dad <em>was or is</em> doom.</p>
<p>If you pour water in the glass, he finds a way to point out the glass is half empty.</p>
<p>And I guess you could say that quality is ingrained in me too.</p>
<p>I struggled to build confidence or just <em>feel</em> confident. I tried playing the same game. The one he coached where if you fail seven out of ten times, you&rsquo;re considered good. And I had moments, but my confidence was never <em>strong</em>.</p>
<p>This carried over into school and life. Mistakes buried me. Sometimes still do.</p>
<p>Because I look or obsess about the past. But before that, I imagine too much of what could go wrong in the future, and find myself looking back at the past. A cycle that skips the present. Not just skips it. Ignores it.</p>
<p>A vicious cycle.</p>
<p>How can I avoid this cycle?</p>
<hr>
<p>That might be the wrong question to ask. I have learned how to manage it.</p>
<p>Meditation. Exercise. Reading books.</p>
<p>All help.</p>
<p>For example, one my favorite books I&rsquo;ve read recently is <em><a href="https://books.hotdogsandeggs.com/thinkinginbets/#/">Thinking in Bets</a></em> by Annie Duke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about decision making. Annie&rsquo;s <a href="https://t.co/Y53QmmSmP3">newsletter</a> has also been really useful.</p>
<p>In the newsletter earlier this year, she shares the <em>Goat Solution</em>. It&rsquo;s an exercise in perspective and how benchmarks impact our happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A poor farmer goes to a rabbi with a problem. &ldquo;My wife and children are living in a small house and it&rsquo;s unbearable. Life couldn&rsquo;t get worse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rabbi asked, &ldquo;Do you have a goat?&rdquo; The farmer, puzzled, nodded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Move the goat into your house with your family.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t dare question the reasoning of the rabbi, who was legendary for his wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the objections of his family, he brought the goat to live in the house, and it was a disaster.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The goat smashed the furniture, ate everything in sight, and smelled &hellip; like a goat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He returned to the rabbi, panic-stricken. Life had never been more horrible. He needed something - anything - to relieve his family&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rabbi said, &ldquo;Remove the goat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That story makes much sense to me.</p>
<p>Because it could always be worse. <em>Always</em>.</p>
<p>And you know what, it could always be better too.</p>
<p>But it is what it is right now. That&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to add some practicality to my pessimism.</p>
<p>Tim Ferriss even calls it <a href="https://youtu.be/RwosCDOwRHQ?t=50">practical pessimism</a>.</p>
<p>Annie Duke even references in her book that there is power in negative visualization. Because it <a href="https://books.hotdogsandeggs.com/thinkinginbets/#/38">helps us achieve our goals</a>.</p>
<p>The key is not to only negatively visualize what might happen. But to include some positive visualization too.</p>
<p>Doom <em>can</em> be useful. It just needs a counterpart. A partner.</p>
<p>If there is doom, you also need some gloom.</p>
<p>Without it, you&rsquo;re incomplete. Out of whack. Extreme.</p>
<p>You need balance.</p>
<p>When you wonder if things couldn&rsquo;t be any worse, get a goat.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, yes, I was a negative piece of shit.</p>
<p>And you know, I still am in many ways. Just a <em>little bit</em> less.</p>
<p>More like 60%, not 70%.</p>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t 0% either. It&rsquo;s more like 50%.</p>
<p>Half and half. Negative and positive.</p>
<p>Doom and gloom.</p>
