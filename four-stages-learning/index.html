				<p>John Beilein is the head coach for men&rsquo;s basketball at the University of Michigan. Beilein&rsquo;s won over 700 games in his coaching career.</p>
<p>When a freshman joins his team, Beilein shares how they get up to speed. He uses a framework.</p>
<p>The four stages of learning:</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>While I&rsquo;m not a collegiate freshman trying to learn basketball, I&rsquo;ve found this framework really useful in my own learning too.</p>
<h2 id="unconsciously-incompetent">UNconsciously INcompetent</h2>
<p>This is the first stage of learning. You don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re doing things, and you don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>An example in my own life is I started a new job at the beginning of this year (2019). I need to learn the product, the team, the customer, and much more.</p>
<p>When answering a customer&rsquo;s question for the first time, I do my best to troubleshoot. So I search around various resources, and kind of end up in no man&rsquo;s land. Because I don&rsquo;t even know <em>what</em> to search. I don&rsquo;t even know <em>how</em> to describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you asked your dog to shake your hand for the first time. The dog has no idea what it means yet.</p>
<h2 id="consciously-incompetent">Consciously INcompetent</h2>
<p>The second stage of learning is you&rsquo;re <em>aware</em> of what you&rsquo;re doing is wrong. This is a huge step. It means you&rsquo;re listening and slowly beginning to understand the correct or right habits to learn a skill/task.</p>
<p>For example, when I started practicing yoga, I began to pick up on proper alignment with my body in certain poses. In <a href="https://youtu.be/rZUxnUfKXoI">twisted or revolved triangle pose</a>, your hips need to be aligned in order to access the pose.</p>
<p>When I first tried the twist, I kept falling over. I had no balance. And I knew that it was wrong, just not quite sure how to fix it.</p>
<p>Once the teacher told me to put my legs on railroad tracks or spread them out more, I gained more balance and I was able to access the twist.</p>
<p>So now your dog probably knows if it lifts a paw, it gets a treat. And if the dog doesn&rsquo;t lift a paw, no treat.</p>
<h2 id="consciously-competent">Consciously Competent</h2>
<p>The third stage of learning is when you begin to know what you&rsquo;re doing, but it just takes you time to do it. You&rsquo;re starting to develop the habits. You just have to <em>think</em> about the steps a lot. Your experience is still a bit green.</p>
<p>A good example is if you asked a professional chef and I to cook the same meal. I&rsquo;m sure I can follow the recipe or instructions, and understand how to avoid burning food, but it&rsquo;s going to take me a hell of a lot more effort to do it. Plus, the quality is going to be wildly different.</p>
<p>Because a professional chef is comfortable, and has the practice that builds confidence to do it <em>without</em> thinking so much.</p>
<p>Your dog might be a bit reluctant to lift a paw, but its slowly learning how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="unconsciously-competent">UNconsciously Competent</h2>
<p>The final stage of learning is you know exactly what to do <em>without</em> even thinking about it. Now, it&rsquo;s second nature. Natural. You have confidence and you&rsquo;re habits are solid.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve worked the same job for 30 plus years, you&rsquo;re likely unconsciously competent at several tasks. Because you&rsquo;ve had a ton of exposure to the right <em>and the wrong</em> way of doing things. You&rsquo;ve had the right feedback, and you know what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Someone completing a daily commute to work for the 500th time versus the first time is going to be far more successful. Because there is no substitute for exposure.</p>
<p>And by now your dog knows when you say, <em>Shake</em>, it lifts a paw.</p>

<p>No matter what you&rsquo;re learning, whether basketball or teaching an old dog new tricks, this framework is useful.</p>
