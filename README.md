Blog | Hot Dogs and Eggs
========================

This blog was built by Chris Gallo with the help of the internet.

For a beginner, coding is difficult. But when you figure something out it is incredibly rewarding. I tested different ideas using [Codepen](http://codepen.io/cjgallo/), and read countless articles on [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/). Thanks to my friend [James Jackson](https://twitter.com/thejacksonjd) for the advice. 

It's run on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's influenced by [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) built by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and the [Help Scout blog](http://www.helpscout.net/blog/). I write, edit, and revise posts using [Draft](https://draftin.com/) by [Nathan Kontny](https://twitter.com/natekontny).

Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your stay. 

Cheers
