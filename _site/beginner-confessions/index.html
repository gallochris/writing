     <p>This week I put a new coat of paint on my personal website - <a href="http://hotdogsandeggs.com">hotdogsandeggs.com</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote the code from scratch for the first time. It’s effective not elegant. I’m sure there are things I could simplify or improve. If you recognize something that could be better, please let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/cjagllo">@cjgallo</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a beginner. And this is what I learned writing the code on my own.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-scary">It’s Not Scary</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>HTML is just going around with a label maker and throwing labels on everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/2014/02/01/jessica-hische/">Jessica Hische, Learn the Tools</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jessica Hische is a designer. And she preaches how you must learn the tools to make the things you want to make. HTML is not scary or intimidating. You just throw a label on things.</p>

<p>It’s true.</p>

<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/19285?token=bvXoOlz6HkSUab8ZTklLvMXKnGdAw4JbCbsjaEfvSTVgCcoNwe6phRCuqUqgInUQKDw0FEU9lwLbkQ2yL_OrGDM" alt="funny-css.png" /></p>

<p>Rasheed Wallace. Shaq. Muggsy Bogues. Randolph Childress. These are not just great basketball players. But the labels I used when creating the site. They live in a CSS file titled, you guessed it, Tim Duncan.</p>

<p>This is proof that you just throw labels on everything. This makes it easier for me to understand how CSS and HTML work together. Plus, it creates a comfortable feeling because you can name things what you want.</p>

<p>It’s not scary.</p>

<h2 id="rip-something-off">Rip Something Off</h2>

<p><a href="http://humblepied.com/jim-coudal/">Jim Cloudal believes</a> you should find something you like and rip it off.</p>

<p>This is unorthodox advice. But it teaches you how things you like that are made and how you can re-create them.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jim, I ripped off his typography on <a href="http://coudal.com/">Cloudal Partners</a>. The headlines and sub-headings have an old-school feel of a newspaper. With thousands of fonts available today, it’s refreshing what you can do with times new roman.</p>

<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/19286?token=uh3D26Qw5h5bUTgiSRSecnsyPPSu4dBYvLiuwUrEKYuLSk7qTt8CFK5kv0q06V-rF9G_v42ydf1FJdOzgy6uBus" alt="cloudal-typography.png" /></p>

<p>The letter spacing is really what makes this typography so beautiful. It’s easy to read and catches your eye. I’ve used it on the homepage, <a href="http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/">my blog</a>, and <a href="http://http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/">another project</a>.</p>

<p>Another design I sought to rip off was from Frank Chimero. He uses a grid layout of to showcase <a href="http://frankchimero.com/talks/">his talks</a>. The full-width squares or boxes was something that I really wanted to learn how to make.</p>

<p>After toying with re-creating Frank’s design, I realized the squares were not something that was necessary for me. I have four things I want someone to know when they visit <a href="http://hotdogsandeggs.com">hotdogsandeggs.com</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What hot dogs and eggs is</li>
  <li>I share what I know on my blog - <a href="http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.">blog.hotdogsandeggs.com</a></li>
  <li>They can find inspiration from my project - <a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com">people.hotdogsandeggs.com</a></li>
  <li>And who I am - a short bio</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of squares I split the site into these four sections using the full-width design that mirrors Frank’s design. It’s a class titled <em>shaq</em> that includes these styles:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">max-width: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;</code></p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with ripping something off to help you learn. As Frank states on his site, “Be nice. Give credit. Share, don’t steal.”</p>

<h2 id="email-is-a-great-way-to-learn">Email is a Great Way to Learn</h2>

<p>Lots of people want to kill email or declare it’s dying. It’s simply not true. As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/why-email-will-never-die/375973/">Alex Madrigal describes</a>, email is “the cockroach of the Internet.”</p>

<p>It’s not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Writing an HTML email is different. It’s based on a lot of old standards and there is a lot that you cannot do. But you can use  inline styles. This means the CSS is written in combination with the HTML.</p>

<p>It can be exhausting, but I find it to be a great way to learn.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RodriguezCommaJ">Jason Rodriguez</a> delivers a <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/can-email-be-responsive">great explanation</a> of how to write and design an HTML email. He describes why HTML sucks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s like getting into a time machine and stepping out into a hellish ’90s world of table-based layouts, inline styles, non-semantic markup, and client-specific hacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/can-email-be-responsive">Jason Rodriguez, Can Email be Responsive?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the annoyances of writing code for email comes lots of opportunity to learn. For example, using <a href="https://github.com/rodriguezcommaj/salted">Salted</a> - a responsive template from Jason and <a href="https://litmus.com/">Litmus</a> - I discovered ways to build bulletproof buttons.</p>

<p>As a beginner, I thought a fancy button must always be an image. Since lots of email clients strip images, the bulletproof button approach makes a lot of sense when writing an HTML email.</p>

<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/19287?token=ZLMu3XAnhOedYifGvcAeCLI-BF8R0F3idZ1UODSHFh3txg6vSoiZCpYX1e0u5Sp18CNMCkRLZldYuuzRjHIx-gU" alt="people-hotdogsandeggs.png" /></p>

<p>Using CSS instead, I discovered how to make beautiful buttons without using an image. You will find the same types of buttons on my site that you will in the Salted email template.</p>

<p>After reading through <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/553802085401758894/">an example</a> of the Salted template, you also find it’s easy to digest information too. This design inspired me to re-create something similar for my site. Four sections with clear calls to action and easy to digest language.</p>

<p>Yes, writing an HTML email is a pain. But it forces you to understand how code works and why you should use specific approaches in certain situations.</p>

<p>It’s an awesome way to learn.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So What’s Next?</h2>

<p>Learning to code is not easy. But it’s so rewarding when you build something that makes you proud.</p>

<p>There’s a ton more for me to learn. And I can’t wait.</p>
