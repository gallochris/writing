     <p>How do people use Coca-Cola?</p>

<p>I realize that this might be a wide-eyed question.</p>

<p>They drink it, right?</p>

<p>People drink Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>Of course, they do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/">The estimated daily servings</a> of Coca-Cola beverages is 1.9 billion.</p>

<p>But what if people use Coca-Cola in another way?</p>

<hr />

<p>How do people use your product? All in the same way?</p>

<p>Marketing is exhausting right now. The people who describe what a product does rarely use the product.</p>

<p>People use acronyms and jargon.</p>

<p>We're a CRM. Full-service web solutions. It's like Groupon for clergy members.</p>

<p>We're all guilty. I work with a small team on <a href="https://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a>. It can be described as a CRM.</p>

<p>I have no idea what CRM means. Oh, I know what it stands for.</p>

<p>Customer relationship management.</p>

<p>But what does that mean?</p>

<p>If someone asks me how people use Highrise, I could say like a CRM.</p>

<p>But I try not to describe Highrise as a CRM. Because that's not how all people use it.</p>

<p>Our team tries to focus on the <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/hidden/">jobs people get done</a> with Highrise. Why do they hire it?</p>

<p>Highrise customers include real estate agents, nuns, and screenwriters.</p>

<p>Do you think all these people use it in the same way?</p>

<hr />

<p>I couldn't understand what I was seeing. "Why the hell are they doing that?" I asked.</p>

<p>If you've never attended a NASCAR race, I recommend you do because it will change your perspective.</p>

<p>You might consider NASCAR to be a hilly-billy sport. Or maybe you don't even consider a sport at all. I'm not here to debate that.</p>

<p>NASCAR is a business, a multi-billion dollar one too. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/nascar-valuations/">That's a fact</a>.</p>

<p>The access NASCAR gives fans is unreal. I had a chance to find this out myself a few years ago.</p>

<p>I had a <em>Hot Pass</em>, which means I was allowed to walk around when the garage was "hot" or cars were moving around.</p>

<p>Each car has its own team. The team consists of a driver, crew chief, jackman, gas man, tire changer, utility man, etc.</p>

<p>Lots are involved in making sure the car is working properly.</p>

<p>What can your team accomplish in 11 seconds?</p>

<p>That's considered an above average pit stop for most NASCAR pit crews.</p>

<p>So, "Why they hell are they doing that again?"</p>

<p>I asked as I saw the pit crew pouring out full two-liters of Coca-Cola on the asphalt.</p>

<p>A friend replied, "Oh, that's to keep the ground sticky for the pit crew. Can't slip or it will cost you when making a pit stop."</p>

<p>Pit crews look for any advantage they can get. 11 seconds is not a long time.</p>

<p>They're resourceful. If they <a href="http://www.thenascarinsiders.com/2010/03/03/pit-stalls-a-sticky-situation/">need more traction</a>, they'll figure out a way.</p>

<p>But I thought people only drink Coca-Cola?</p>

<hr />

<p>I've seen customers use Highrise to keep track of who they talk to, what they talk about, and when to follow-up.</p>

<p>I've also seen folks use Highrise in a way that's equivalent to pouring Coca-Cola on asphalt instead of drinking it.</p>

<p>After conversing with customers every day, I've learned people use products how they want to.</p>

<p>Not how <em>you</em> want them too. How <em>they</em> want to. It's <em>their</em> choice.</p>

<p>Look around. Examples are all over the place.</p>

<p>People <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/can-you-really-cook-salmon-in-a-dishwasher-putting-tips-to-the-test-in-the-kitchn-218048">cook salmon with their dish washer</a>.</p>

<p>Use an <a href="http://www.snotr.com/video/8965/So_papa__how_do_you_like_the_iPad_we_got_you">iPad as a cutting board</a>.</p>

<p>Pack <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5874035/pack-shoes-in-hotel-shower-caps-to-keep-your-luggage-contents-clean">shoes in a shower cap</a>.</p>

<p>Not only pour Coca-Cola on the ground, but <a href="http://prop-tricks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/clean-penny-with-coke-209448/">use it to clean pennies</a>.</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong way to use a product.</p>

<p>Because the person using the product decides how they use it.</p>
