     <p>Almost every weekday morning this past summer, I went to my local YMCA to exercise. When entering the gym, you stop to grab a key from the YMCA staff to put your things in a locker.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of different locker keys. Like most people, I am a creature of habit and I want to choose the exact same locker every time. Locker key 161. After two days of choosing locker number 161 - the YMCA staff member started to listen to my habit.</p>

<p>The next day when I sped down the stairs towards the locker room, the YMCA attendant grabbed locker key 161 and handed it to me all in one motion as I entered the locker room. No words even exchanged - she knew exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>By listening to what I do, she saved me maybe all of 15 seconds. But the emotional feeling that she paid attention and knew exactly what I wanted without me asking - powerful. It made me come back again and again. Because I knew the YMCA cared.</p>

<p>A month later, I again went down the stairs towards the lockers. She was gone. And the new locker attendant listened to what I said, but not what I did. I had to ask for locker key 161 everyday, and he never noticed or remembered.</p>

<p>A few months later I cancelled my membership. The price was a factor, but the emotional reason was about the locker key. The expectation evaporated. YMCA cared about me, but removed the feeling of connection.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>“Retention, the data said, was driven by emotional factors, such as whether the employees knew members’ names or said hello when they walked in.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/081298160X">Charles Duhigg, The Power of Habit</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duhigg tackles the idea of habits with a parallel example of the YMCA in his book. The YMCA tabbed a social scientist, Bill Lazarus, and a mathematician, Dean Abbott, to learn more about retaining their customers.</p>

<p>The data found people go to the gym for a human connection. Not to exercise. People go to the YMCA for social reasons - to meet a friend. And when they meet a friend, they are much more likely to keep coming back.</p>

<p>When the locker attendant grabbed locker key 161 without me saying a word, she made a connection with me. It was familiar to see her, and it kept bringing me back.</p>

<p>Until she left, and the experience became foreign. Not familiar.</p>

<hr />

<p>Empathy is motivation. And as a listener, empathy is your <a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/simon-sinek/">greatest skill</a>.  Because there are two ways to listen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You can listen to what people say, sure. But you will be far more effective if you listen to what people do.”</p>
</blockquote>
