     <p>We live in a copycat world. We use the internet as a crutch for any problem we try to solve. And the result is lots and lots of noise.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to be original, we resort to what others have done before. For example, new companies describe what they do with hollow explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're the Wikipedia for Alcoholics</li>
<li>We handcraft brand experiences to enable brand advocates &amp; consumers.</li>
<li>Making the world a better place through constructing elegant hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility.</li>
</ul>


<p>The consequence? By trying to outdo the competition, you end up with bloated solutions full of bullshit.  Or more adequately defined:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Superfluous, unneccessary</li>
<li>Cluttered, clunky, or needlessly complex</li>
<li>Intentionally deceptive or insincere</li>
<li>Excrement of an adult male bovine mammal</li>
</ol>


<p>Brad Frost, <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/death-to-bullshit-at-creative-mornings/">Death to Bullshit</a></p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The classic example here is Microsoft and Apple. People wanted several different things out of a computer operating system. And that's what Microsoft gave them with Windows.</p>

<p>It led to a swollen operating system that people struggled to find useful. There were even <a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/faqtip/windows-7-tip-of-the-week-remove-the-windows-features-you-dont-need">articles</a> written about removing features you don't need. Windows became bullshit.</p>

<p>What people really wanted out of an operating system was Macintosh OS X. It does less than Windows, and is twice as useful. It's beautiful.</p>

<p>Here's 3 other examples to illustrate why you should do less than competition.</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. We just want the forecast</h2>

<p>The Weather Company, yes that's actually its name, has evolved into a news site that does everything but give you what you want. The weather. It's full of mindless information.</p>

<p>An upstart, <a href="http://forecast.io/">forecast.io</a>, delivers exactly what you want - the weather. Forecast.io does less than <a href="http://www.weather.com/">weather.com</a>, and that's why people love it.</p>

<p>Meteorologists get paid to be wrong. I didn't think you could screw up that up. But The Weather Company accomplishes this in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/ydqznjcrlmwffw.jpg"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/ydqznjcrlmwffw_small.jpg" alt="weather-example.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2>2. We just want to see the menu</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/menu.aspx">In-n-out</a> makes delicious hamburgers. And their menu is stupid simple. Double-double. Cheeseburger. Fries. Shake or drink. And if it's too plain for you, they have a dynamite <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx">secret menu</a> with 6 additional options.</p>

<p>McDonalds has grown into a me-too brand. They do everything from salads to snacks to coffee to Shamrock Shakes. You have to explore their menu. I'm serious, McDonald's has a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/full_menu_explorer.html">full menu explorer</a>.</p>

<p><em>One-hundred and eighty-seven</em>. That's how many items are on the McDonald's menu explorer. In-n-out lets you choose from 11 total options, and they keep 6 of them a secret. 11 is not greater than 187, but it's better.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/z60emnhjyq4da.jpg"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/z60emnhjyq4da_small.jpg" alt="menu-example.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2>3. We just want to write</h2>

<p>Google is a behemoth of a company. I use several of their products on a daily basis. But I find writing in Google Docs is full of distractions. Unnecessary features that make me feel like Microsoft Word just moved to the cloud.</p>

<p>A simple approach is <a href="https://draftin.com/">Draft</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/natekontny">Nathan Kontny</a>. It gives you only what you need and makes it pleasant to write. There not a slew of superfluous buttons, just the canvas to put your thoughts down.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/qz1syrc7v2lq3w.jpg"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/qz1syrc7v2lq3w_small.jpg" alt="writing-example.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Google believes it's giving you everything you need to write online. Except I don't need a ruler, add ons, and print icon. Draft is the closest experience to writing on a physical piece of paper. It's amazing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Don't do more than the competition.</p>

<p>Because when you <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php">try to outdo</a>, you're thinking behind. And never getting ahead.</p>
