     <p>Of course. But maybe.</p>

<p>Louis CK has a fantastic theory. It goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have like, the thing, I believe the good thing, that’s the thing I believe and than there is this thing. And I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain that I call “of course but maybe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Louis CK - <a href="http://youtu.be/bkjmzEEQUlE?t">Of Course, But Maybe</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://youtu.be/bkjmzEEQUlE?t=1m43s">concrete example</a>.</p>

<p>Now how it applies to customer service.</p>

<hr />
<p>##Cancel</p>

<p>Time Warner Cable. No one is fond of this company. And their is a laundry list of reasons.</p>

<p>I’m moving this month and was ready to cancel my internet services. I do not have cable. And as much as that blows the minds of Time Warner representatives, they fail to treat me any differently or even in <a href="https://twitter.com/cjgallo/status/429023436392767488">my native language</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the point. Go to Time Warner Cable’s website right now and try to cancel your account. The process is full of frustration.</p>

<p>You have to search how to cancel. It’s not clear.</p>

<p><em>You can cancel a service, but not your account, by chatting with a customer service representative. Account cancellations must be processed through a customer service representative and cannot be initiated online.</em></p>

<p>So you can bill online. You can shop online. Make an appointment online. But can’t cancel online.</p>

<p>After a 13 minute call with Time Warner Cable, you’re re-routed several times before speaking to someone you can help. The account is finally canceled. But you’re phone looks like a <a href="https://twitter.com/cjgallo/status/474672908208701442/photo/1">baby was using the keypad</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tdsbjcvitlkteg.png"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/tdsbjcvitlkteg_small.png" alt="timewarner.png" /></a></p>

<p>Why not just let people cancel online? It’s a simple process. One that might bring them back again.</p>

<p>Of course, Time Warner Cable doesn’t want customers to cancel. But maybe, if they make it near impossible to cancel - customers will never want to do business with them again.</p>

<hr />

<p>##Unsubscribe</p>

<p>It’s not a favorable word for anyone who is involved in email marketing. But it happens.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard to unsubscribe? But easy to subscribe?</p>

<p>And when you unsubscribe, you receive another email to confirm that you wanted to unsubscribe.</p>

<p>Let’s get this straight. You opt-out of the email list. You make an effort to say - <em>“stop emailing me.”</em> So people just decide to email you again.</p>

<p>People <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanmunson/status/475015842963288064">spell out this frustration</a>. And some have even <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-gmail-unsubscribe/hdkbhdodcejjjicmnmhhibenjmlgmkfc">built Chrome extensions</a> to help you unsubscribe. Shenanigans.</p>

<p>It’s something so easy, yet companies make it so hard.</p>

<p>What if companies sent an email that looks like this?</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/zjv363x13ayq.png"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/zjv363x13ayq_small.png" alt="unsubscribe-gmail.png" /></a></p>

<p>Sure lots of people will unsubscribe. But the ones that didn’t are probably you’re most valuable customers.</p>

<p>Of course, people don’t want you to unsubscribe from their email newsletter. Of course, they don’t.</p>

<p>But maybe, if unsubscribing from your email list is like completing a puzzle - people won’t unsubscribe.</p>

<p>Or maybe they will never subscribe again.</p>

<hr />

<p>##Credit Card Required</p>

<p>Free trials. It’s common in software products. Like a drug dealer. You get a taste of the product for free.</p>

<p>But why do companies want your credit card for the trial?</p>

<p>Prezi hits people with a $159 charge at the end of their free 30 day trial. It’s outlined with sketchy <a href="https://prezi.com/support/article/account/trial-period-faq/?lang=en">documentation</a>, but it’s still not fair. The charge is for an annual fee.</p>

<p>Did we not agree on a month free? This leaves people <a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/prezi/topics/req_for_refund_trial_cancelled_but_still_got_charged_159?topic-reply-list%5Bsettings%5D%5Bfilter_by%5D=all&amp;topic-reply-list%5Bsettings%5D%5Breply_id%5D=12136820#reply_12136820">feeling abused</a>. It shatters trust at the first impression.</p>

<p>Lincoln Murphy <a href="http://sixteenventures.com/saas-free-trial-credit-card">details</a> how requiring a credit card does more harm than good. An example is through <a href="http://hookfeed.com/">Hookfeed</a>.</p>

<p>Hookfeed might be a phenomenal product (never used it). It delivers Stripe analytics to its customers. It might even be a case where a credit card is required. The product is directly related to billing.</p>

<p>Requiring a credit card lost <a href="https://twitter.com/chrimack/status/474372874241716224">them a sale</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/p9uulhldllkza.png"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/p9uulhldllkza_small.png" alt="hookfeed.png" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, you want people to pay for your product. But maybe, if you require a credit card upfront, you will trick them into buying it.</p>

<p>Or maybe you will never earn their business in the first place.</p>

<hr />
<p>Stop making the easy things hard for your customers.</p>
