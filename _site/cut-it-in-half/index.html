  <hr>
     <p>This week my workout was cut in half. Instead of 32 laps in the pool, it's now just 16.</p>

<p>It's a major adjustment. One that is feels twice as hard. It's funny - how can you cut something in half and it be twice as hard?</p>

<hr />

<p>As humans, we're not afraid to use words. Jargon. Buzzwords. Run-on sentences. Big words. Words with no meaning.</p>

<p>Schools train students that length is important. Five paragraph essays. 10 or 20 page papers. If you fill up a whole blue book, you feel more accomplished than if you just wrote one page. More is better.</p>

<p>Why? It's easy to write more. To use fluff and ramble.</p>

<p>It's difficult to make every word count. To save space <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/1539-writing-decisions-saving-space-without-losing-meaning">without losing meaning</a>. It's hard to write with focus.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here's an example - let's look at 2 different email service providers. MailChimp and Constant Contact.</p>

<p>Lots of software companies fail to explain what they <em>actually</em> do. In this example, just take a look at homepage of each company.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/coxvusqpxcvxq.jpg"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/coxvusqpxcvxq_small.jpg" alt="mc-v-cc.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> uses three words. <em>Send better email.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/overview-home?s_tnt=56380:4:0">Constant Contact</a> goes for a 13 word explanation. <em>Successful marketing starts here. Bring your marketing together with the Constant Contact toolkit.</em></p>

<p>Which is more clear? MailChimp explains exactly what you do with their software. It's dead simple. So simple even my mom uses it - not kidding.</p>

<p>Constant Contact leaves you wondering what's in their toolkit. The word marketing is redundant. This is where it starts? And it comes together? It sounds confusing.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean MailChimp is automatically better than Constant Contact. Or you shouldn't do business with Constant Contact. It just illustrates the importance of a simple message.</p>

<p>If it were easy to write less more people would do it. We wouldn't have sentences like <em>"We bring innovation to strategy through Strategic Interrogation, Engineered Creativity and Directed Research" - via <a href="http://designjargonbullshit.com/">designjargonbullshit.com</a></em>. More words might sound elegant to you, but it just makes other people scratch their head.</p>

<p>Suck it up. Write short. Use small words.</p>

<blockquote><p>A few good words can be worth a thousand pictures.</p>

<p>Roy Peter Clark, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Short-Craft-Times/dp/0316204358">How to Write Short</a></p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The pool switched to a long course. Instead of 25 meters, it's now 50 meters. The 16 laps are the same distance as the 32 laps.</p>

<p>My workout didn't lose any purpose when you cut it in half.</p>

<p><em>It got better.</em></p>
