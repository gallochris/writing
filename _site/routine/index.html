     <p><em>You work from home? How great is that?</em></p>

<p><em>Do you watch TV all day and wear pajamas?</em></p>

<p>Not exactly. The part about the pajamas might be true sometimes. But it is the opposite of what a lot of people think.</p>

<p>I have worked remotely, or from home, for a little over a year now. The truth is you do not work less. You are tempted to work more.</p>

<p>Sometimes a lot more.</p>

<hr />

<p>I used to commute to work every day. A 45 minute or hour long drive. I would get on the road around 6 AM and get home around 6:30 or 7 PM. That is a lot of time in the car.</p>

<p>I worked in agencies where we had meetings that lasted so long there was a line to the bathroom when it was complete. A lot of time talking and not doing.</p>

<p>I remember being in open offices and getting interrupted by someone sneezing or getting up to get a drink. Someone is tapping you on the shoulder. You are never able to string together a quiet 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Now that I work remotely, almost all of these things have vanished.</p>

<p>I have more time.</p>

<p>At first, you might find yourself taking advantage of all this newfound time.</p>

<p>You might make dinner instead of getting take out. But soon you will find yourself working again after you eat.</p>

<p>When you blur the line between work and home, it is easy to work more. It can be dangerous. And lead to all sorts of burnout.</p>

<p>How do you avoid it?</p>

<hr />

<p>A routine.</p>

<p>The boring, methodical, and uninteresting things you do every day.</p>

<p>A routine is crucial to working at home.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<blockquote><p>Stress comes from a lack of control.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote>

<p>A routine is where you find control. Without one, you lose control. And on comes the stress of working more than you should.</p>

<p>What does a routine look like?</p>

<p>Here is my routine this summer.</p>

<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/30187?token=qqXlhUdYiD8UBydn6iGmF9XnKeRldGrUM_nJlHki29aj0z7ODEROtWHXuqTNKS986VJ06LUXuV8USxEuxa4HS78" alt="routine.png" /></p>

<p>A few things to keep in mind about my routine.</p>

<p><strong>It is Subject to Change</strong></p>

<p>My routine changes with the seasons. For example, I love waking up early, but when it is cold and dark in the winter, that is a bit tricky.</p>

<p>My routine is not full proof. Things happen and come up. I cannot always follow it. But when I do, I feel in control.</p>

<p><strong>Email</strong></p>

<p>I do not recommend everyone check email at the hours that I do.
I work in customer support. Our company is never closed. People from around the world use our software 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<p>We only provide email support. It is like a leaky faucet. Customers can always email you. Sometimes the faucet is on full blast. Other times it drips.</p>

<p>We do not have 24 hour coverage yet for our customers. This is the reason I check and answer emails for 30 minutes when I wake up and before I go to bed.</p>

<p>The emails will always be there. But if I can chip away at emails now, it is a reward for me when I am back online later.</p>

<p><strong>Balance and Variety</strong></p>

<p>A routine by definition does not involve much variety. But balance is key.</p>

<p>The days are almost identical. In the mornings, I find a different form of exercise is important. Yoga and swimming are a good mix for me.</p>

<p>Twice a week, I try to sleep in an hour longer. This is huge. It allows extra rest, but also feels like another reward for my body.</p>

<p>A little variety is good. Balance is better.</p>

<p><strong>Friction</strong></p>

<p>This is another quote that stuck with me from Jeff Bezos.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to do more of something, make the friction less.</p>

<p>If you want to do less of something, make the friction more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bezos gives the example of putting the bag of potato chips on top the refrigerator, if you do not want to eat a lot of chips. This increases the friction and makes it harder for you to do.</p>

<p>The same is true with your routine.</p>

<p>When I am on my routine, in order to respond to a work email, I must be in the specific room where I keep my computer. It is a rule. I do not use my phone or another device to respond to work emails.</p>

<p>This means if I am in bed, and something pops up, I would have to get out of bed and travel to the room with my computer. I am increasing the friction, so I do not answer emails at all hours of the day. I am in control.</p>

<p>Now, when I am off my routine, traveling or in a new location, stress arrives again. My computer is a step away in the same room with my bed. There is almost no friction.</p>

<p>It is easy to open the computer and respond to emails after hours. It is a tough habit to break. I am not in control.</p>

<hr />

<p>After working remotely for a year, I am not sure I could ever go back to working in an office.</p>

<p>The amount of time you gain is priceless.</p>

<p>I am also not sure I could ever survive without a routine. It puts me in control.</p>
