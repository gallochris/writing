     <p>Yesterday I requested an Uber and got much more than a ride home. I learned something.</p>

<p>Andy, my driver, was polite. We talked about his morning. How it was going. Small talk. The weather.</p>

<p>I asked, “How do you like working for Uber?”</p>

<p>Andy responded and spiraled into a rant about ratings.</p>

<p>He mentions how he received a bad rating from a customer. But the rating wasn’t <em>his fault</em>.</p>

<p>He dropped someone off, and they left trash directly behind his seat. Andy couldn’t see it, and when he picked up the next person, there was the trash.</p>

<p>The next customer saw the trash, got dropped off, and gave Andy a bad rating because his car was dirty.</p>

<p>“I got a bad rating, and didn’t even know why. It wasn’t <strong>my fault.</strong> The last person who was in my car left a ton of trash behind my seat.”</p>

<p>That’s tough.</p>

<hr />

<p>I could relate to Andy. After spending the last few years in the support inbox, I’ve wrestled with blame every damn day.</p>

<p>Customers blame you. And it’s not your fault they’re using Internet Explorer. Or they forgot their password. Or their credit card expired.</p>

<p>You can blame them. It’s easy. It takes no effort at all to place blame. None. All you need is a finger to point.</p>

<p>But does that help?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once you’re blaming, you can’t change. You’re just dependent on the other side. In fact, you’re their prisoner.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>William Ury, <a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/william-ury/">a conversation with Simon Sinek</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blame is placing all the responsibility on someone else. It never helps. Not in any relationship.</p>

<p>Instead of putting the responsibility on someone else. Take it.</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean it’s your fault. It means you’re part of the problem. You could be a small part of it, but you’re in it. Accept that.</p>

<p>Because once you accept that you’re part of it, you can change it.</p>

<p>You can ask what version of Internet Explorer they’re using or if they can try another browser.</p>

<p>You can send a password reset link or reset the password for them.</p>

<p>Ask if they have a different credit card. Share steps to update their credit card.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can take responsibility. Do it. Because it’s contagious.</p>

<p>Once you take responsibility, people are more likely to work with you instead of blame you.</p>

<p><strong>The opposite of blame is taking responsibility.</strong></p>
