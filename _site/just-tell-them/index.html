     <p>Your product isn't perfect. It has rough edges. Parts that take some time to understand. And things that aren't easy on the first or second try.</p>

<p>You know where your customers might struggle. The tasks that take
more time than they should. The point where frustration sets in.</p>

<p>You put together resources to help customers get acclimated to your product. Videos. Help articles. Text snippets.</p>

<p>But do you tell your customers where they're going to struggle? Or just make it seem like it's not hard for anyone else?</p>

<p>It took a while for this to sink in for me. I would send over links to outdated help articles. I would dance around the fact that certain things were going to be hard.</p>

<p>But then I started trying another approach.</p>

<blockquote><p>The big problem is not that the manual is hard (or bad). The problem is that we act as though it's not.</p>

<p>You can fix the problem immediately without fixing the manual.</p>

<p><em>Just tell them.</em>
Try it. It's like a superpower. Not for you, for <em>them.</em></p>

<p>Kathy Sierra, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036593.do">Badass: Making Users Awesome</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I'm honest.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>This is going to involve more steps than you'd like, but we're only an email away if you need more help.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>You're exactly right, it's a pain. We don't do a great job of handling this right now.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>We know that's not the answer you'd like, but hope it clarifies. And I've shared this example with our team as another vote for these upgrades.</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>And it pays off. Because when you're honest, people start to show confidence in you. <em>They begin to trust you.</em></p>

<p>Your customers don't need you to be perfect. They need you to be honest.</p>

<p>Just tell them.</p>
