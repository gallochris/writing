  <h1>Learning with goals</h1>

3 minutes</span> to read.</p>

  </header>
				<p>At the end of last year, I <a href="https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/goals-2022/">published a few different goals</a> for the year.</p>
<p>This an update on the progress and some things I&rsquo;ve learned so far.</p>
<h2 id="run-no-less-than-15-miles-and-no-more-than-25-miles-in-a-week">Run no less than 15 miles and no more than 25 miles in a week</h2>
<p>Progress here is good. Using Strava, I&rsquo;ve logged 464 miles this calendar year. Given we&rsquo;re about 23 weeks into the year, that&rsquo;s an average of 20.17 miles a week.</p>
<p>My wife and I welcomed our first child in March, and this slowed progress on the goal. Sleep deprived runs are an awful idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned two main things so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>A race is a way to accelerate your training</li>
<li>Exercise is more for your mind than your body</li>
</ul>
<p>I completed the Elizabeth 8K at the end of April. The race is around five miles and my goal was to run it in under 38 minutes. I met that goal and <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/en-US/results/detail/us3su7mgvvhy57qn">finished</a> in around 36 minutes.</p>
<p>This race helped me continue to run each week and train. Once I knew I could run a 10K, I could focus on running the 8K race and picking up my pace.</p>
<p>Along the way, I&rsquo;ve learned just being outside and running helps my mental state. It&rsquo;s so useful to see the sky and get outside. It helps my perspective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever want to run a marathon or even a half-marathon, but one modest race or so a year might be a way to keep training enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="read-at-least-one-book-and-no-more-than-three-books-every-three-months">Read at least one book and no more than three books every three months</h2>
<p>Progress is <em>blurry</em>. I read bits and pieces of a couple business books and a parenting book. I did finish <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dilla-Time-Afterlife-Producer-Reinvented/dp/0374139946">Dilla Time</a>, an awesome book about legendary producer J Dilla.</p>
<p>Learnings with this goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business or work books can be triggering and exhausting</li>
<li>I like biographies and reading about history</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried finishing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/">The Build Trap</a>, a book about product management. A lot of interesting concepts, but it was exhausting to read after being overwhelmed from a work day. I found myself not wanting to read <em>about work</em> when <em>not working</em>. I really lacked motivation and just stopped reading the book.</p>
<p>I like documentaries, biographies, and history. I like the truth. I like reading about how accomplished people are simply just human beings with flaws like all of us. Dilla Time was a great book because it incorporated almost all of those things, and it reminded me of music I first listened to years ago.</p>
<p>I may experiment with listening to audio books as an alternative way to reach this goal.</p>
<h2 id="write-and-share-code-snippets-at-least-once-a-week">Write and share code snippets at least once a week</h2>
<p>Progress was shaky, but it&rsquo;s back on track. I&rsquo;m now focusing on learning R, and sharing code in <a href="https://github.com/gallochris/caRolina">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>The big learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to expand the scope and not make progress</li>
<li>Small steps can create a habit to establish some discipline</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve thought about building a web app or creating a blog about data science. This slowed my progress because it was too ambitious. Where do you start?</p>
<p>I reminded myself I can publish and share code immediately. This is what I&rsquo;ve now done with <a href="https://github.com/gallochris/caRolina">caRolina</a>, where I&rsquo;m sharing code that makes charts and graphs about Carolina sports.</p>
<p>The small step of just using a GitHub repo has helped me create a habit of sharing code at least once a week. It&rsquo;s been a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>My hope is to continue on this path because I think R is a powerful way to communicate with data.</p>
