<p>Here&rsquo;s a secret from the support team at Highrise. Customer support metrics make us feel icky.</p>

<p>Our team doesn&rsquo;t know our satisfaction score. We&rsquo;ve never asked any of the people that use Highrise to try those types of surveys.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t give you an exact number for our average response time. It depends. Sometimes it&rsquo;s 90 seconds, and other times it&rsquo;s within 24 hours.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t tell you our average handle time for an issue. Our team has a general idea, but no exact number.</p>

<p>These types of customer support metrics aren&rsquo;t wrong. We&rsquo;re sure they work for other support teams.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re just not sure they&rsquo;re right for us.</p>

<p>Because there is one piece of knowledge we&rsquo;ve come to realize: <strong>data is man-made</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-mean-data-is-man-made">What do you mean data is man-made?</h2>

<p>Data or metrics or stats are all man-made. A human decides what to measure, how to measure it, how to present it, and how to share it with others.</p>

<p>But why does it matter to measure these things? <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/real-time-dashboards-considered-harmful-7ab026942ac#.ssz9jaflz">And what&rsquo;s the point?</a></p>

<p>A lot of times people avoid these questions when it comes to data. Companies copy what other teams measure, ignoring the fact if it&rsquo;s important to measure the same things in the same way, or if it&rsquo;s even important to measure it at all.</p>

<h2 id="but-isn-t-all-data-objective">But isn&rsquo;t all data objective?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people view numerical data as more trustworthy than qualitative data.</p>

<p>Clayton Christensen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612">Competing Against Luck</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Numbers are black and white. Concrete. You can trust the numbers.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Nope. Almost all data is built on biases and judgement. Because humans are deciding what to measure, how to measure, and why to measure.</p>

<p>Numbers fit perfectly into a spreadsheet or a graph. A number gives a <em>definitive</em> answer to questions like how much or how many.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should treat those numbers as <em>insights</em> and act immediately. Data shouldn&rsquo;t be used to prove a point.</p>

<p>Data should be used to fuel your imagination.</p>

<h2 id="words-numbers">Words &gt; Numbers</h2>

<p>Qualitative data isn&rsquo;t easy. There aren&rsquo;t any formulas or simple math. It doesn&rsquo;t fit into a spreadsheet. It doesn&rsquo;t answer questions. It&rsquo;s not black and white.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s colorful. Messy. Qualitative data creates more questions. It&rsquo;s not simple to present or share with others. It takes some time.</p>

<p>Our support team has found one thing to be true. Qualitative data is worth it. 100 percent worth it.</p>

<p>For example, our team recently <a href="http://blog.highrisehq.com/post/153354155666/filter-ui-updates">updated the filters in Highrise</a>. This update was to an earlier revision to filters we made during the year.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t driven by one piece of data. One piece of quantitative data. It came from a new user:</p>

<p><em>Thanks for pointing out those filters. I didn&rsquo;t even know they were there. Those icons weren&rsquo;t obvious to me at first.</em></p>

<p>This hit all of us across the nose. The filters looked better, aesthetically it was a much more clean than the <a href="https://cl.ly/2S3V332N281E">previous design</a>. But how to use the filters wasn&rsquo;t as obvious any longer.</p>

<p>Folks need to find a specific set of contacts in the <em>city of: Chicago</em>, that have the <em>value: Interested</em> in the <em>custom field: Status</em>, and that are <em>tagged: Potential</em>.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear how to do that, so our team made a change.</p>

<p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/48870?token=KjKIKSoBT_Eeuyaeb9xQH-9UNDo45bUXPPtz6jse9AG4I84q0exg0u6CtEPBFQmB-fVA958PC72ZeTS2TJVW_q8" alt="new-old-filters.gif" /></p>

<p>Quantitative data didn&rsquo;t tell us we needed to make this change. It was all qualitative.</p>

<p>Questions from customers and questions from our team. It was a conversation. There is not a numerical value you can put on that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="so-what-do-we-measure">So what do we measure?</h2>

<p>Instead of striving to lower our average response time or improve our customer satisfaction score, our support team is aiming for something a bit different. Something harder to measure. It&rsquo;s not a number.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/alisongroves">Alison</a> would say, we strive to put ourselves out of work.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse that with us not wanting to work at Highrise. We love it, and love working with our small team.</p>

<p>What we mean is we want to make it easier for people to use Highrise. We want to create a product that is so obvious and so easy to use that we seldom get questions on how to use it.</p>

<p>And when folks do have questions, we want to have resources available to them right away, so they can help themselves. So if someone has a question at 2 am in the morning, and we&rsquo;re not around, they can find an answer without waiting for us.</p>

<p>Because we don&rsquo;t believe managing a number is going to improve our support. We believe focusing on customers and what they are trying to do with Highrise is going to make a better product, and better support.</p>

<p><em>Please don&rsquo;t take this as gospel. What works for our team, might not work for your team. And vice versa.</em></p>

<p><em>Chapter 9 of Clayton Christensen&rsquo;s recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612">Competing Against Luck</a>, was a big inspiration for this post. The entire book is great, and you should check it out.</em></p>
