Experience separates the old from the young. The good from the bad. The disciplined from the reckless. 

But how do you get experience? 

* * *

I remember asking myself this question. Like a lot of my peers, I lost out on several jobs because of one thing. Experience. 

It's a deflating cycle. Why do you need experience to get experience? If you had experience, you wouldn't need experience. 

The truth is experience is all around you. It comes from the most unlikely places. You just have to open your eyes and embrace it.

## Know why and where you are going. 

Don't just do whatever makes you happy. That is empty advice. Max Temkin and the founders of Cards Against Humanity shared their values and beliefs. Be funny and stay independent.

Temkin's business experience prior to building a best-selling board game? A summer at Radioshack. Now he shares his [experiences](http://blog.maxistentialism.com/post/47207276845/kickstarter) with others.

## Connect the dots. 

Gary Vaynerchuk is a salesman. He's built a multi-million dollar wine business, wrote best-selling books, and now runs a successful creative agency. Before all that, he came from zero. 

He went from selling baseball cards to selling wine. Because he connected the dots of his past experiences.

## Put in the time.

Louis C.K. started doing standup in 1984. As a writer on the Conan O'Brien Show, he once played a tree in a sketch. He didn't all of sudden become great. 

It took patience and persistence to win Emmys. It took doing things for free. It took experience.

If you want more experience, share what you believe. Try new things. Volunteer. Work for nothing. Be patient. Ask for help. 

Experience.
