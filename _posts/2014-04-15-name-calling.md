Users. Clients. Customers. Subscribers. Leads.  

Have you ever been called one of these? 

Your startup doesn't have users. Your agency doesn't have clients. Your store doesn't have customers. Your blog doesn't have subscribers. And your website doesn't have leads. 

* * * 

Stop the name calling. 

They are people. Husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters. And these people are the most important aspect to you.  

Because people don't care about how much you know, until they first know that you care about them. People have needs. They need to be loved, recognized, and respected. 

You should strive to make every person glad that he or she interacted with you. Because when you are helpful and useful to people, a funny thing happens. They return the favor. 

Make people glad. Reward them. And before you know it, people start rewarding you.   

* * * 

Because no one wants to be treated as a user. People want to be treated like people.
