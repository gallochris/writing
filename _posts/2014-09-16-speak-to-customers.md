Last week a customer asked me, “Will your code slow down my website?”

This was an easy answer. “No, our code is asynchronous.”

Boom. Case closed.

Except the customer had no idea what asynchronous really meant. Or how it related to our code.

I said it again, “Asynchronous.” This time I fumbled over the word. It’s a mouthful. 

The customer was puzzled. And I was frustrated too.
