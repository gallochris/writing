				<p>We all procrastinate.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s watching another episode of Veronica Mars instead of cleaning the kitchen, or scrolling through Twitter instead of responding to that email, or grabbing lunch with a friend instead of working out.</p>

<p>Procrastination is something we all do.</p>

<p><a href="http://danariely.com/">Dan Ariely</a>, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics, describes procrastination as a dilemma. This dilemma is between what is good for us now and what is good for us in the long term.</p>

<p>Ariely authored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Irrational-Bundle-Predictably-Irrationality-ebook/dp/B00BHEJ4IW">three fascinating books</a>, exploring the intersection of  psychology and economics, and how humans are predictably irrational.</p>

<p>The experiments featured in his books include serving beer with vinegar, giving away free Hershey’s Kiss, and allowing college students to choose deadlines or no deadlines when submitting final papers.</p>

<p>As I found myself re-reading through his books, one point jumped out at me and hit me right between the eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification, my friends, is procrastination.</p>

<p>Dan Ariely, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248">Predictably Irrational</a></p>

<hr />

<p>If you&rsquo;re working with customers every day, you experience some highs and lows.</p>

<p>Yes, you might be the person that takes the brunt of complaints or be berated by someone else.</p>

<p>But more often than not, you&rsquo;re the first one to receive praise and thanks from others too. <a href="https://twitter.com/carokopp">Carolyn Kopprasch</a> explains these are the <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/customer-service-success-stories/">Warm Fuzzies</a>.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve found at <a href="https://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a>, there are ways to earn the Warm Fuzzies and avoid the rants or complaints.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned doing the work for the customer and saving them time brings lots of Warm Fuzzies. Or commenting on their business or website is good for a thank you too.</p>

<p>Another tough lesson is that you can&rsquo;t always get the Warm Fuzzies. Sometimes you have to disappoint people that are using your product.</p>

<p>Highrise hasn&rsquo;t been updated for a very long time. We&rsquo;re fortunate to have an awesome group of customers, but all of us have gotten very used to how Highrise works. Our <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3837-combine">small team</a> of five people is tasked with making the product better.</p>

<p>The challenge is there are lots of ways to make it better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve scrolled through past customer history and found customers demanding for identical feature requests in 2010 as they do today.</p>

<p>Our iPhone app is outdated. It looks sharp on an iPhone 4, but customers ask us almost daily when the new app will be completed.</p>

<p>Android app? Highrise has never built their own native Android app. But some customers think without one, Highrise is useless.</p>

<p>After an interaction with one customer, it became clear to me that there are just some people you have to disappoint.</p>

<p>A few feature request emails back and forth, me explaining how we&rsquo;re going to consider ways to make this easier in the future, the customer&rsquo;s patience evaporated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you making changes, but none help me. This can&rsquo;t be that hard. Just fix it. It&rsquo;s probably one-day total of development time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This all brought me back to procrastination.</p>

<hr />

<p>A lot of the practical advice about procrastination is about ways to overcome it.</p>

<p>13 tips to help you stop procrastinating. Yes, I find it ironic that&rsquo;s a BuzzFeed headline.</p>

<p>We associate procrastination with being bad. It&rsquo;s something we need to beat or overcome.</p>

<p>But is it?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/paulg">Paul Graham</a> makes a case for <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">good and bad procrastination</a>.</p>

<p>As Ariely teaches us, procrastination is a dilemma. Graham details the three types of procrastination, explaining instead of working on something you either:</p>

<ol>
<li>do nothing</li>
<li>do something less important</li>
<li>do something more important</li>
</ol>

<p>The first option is what we all think of procrastination, doing nothing at all.</p>

<p>Graham argues the third option is good procrastination. And the most dangerous type of procrastination, or the bad, is the second option.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re spending time doing something less important, it means you&rsquo;re not spending time doing something more important.</p>

<p>You can rearrange your whole inbox and label specific messages. And you would probably feel like you got something done, but you didn&rsquo;t reply to a single email.</p>

<p>Bad procrastination shakes the hand and plays nice with easy problems. The cross-it-off your to-do list problems. The type of problems that bring immediate gratification.</p>

<p>Choosing to do something more important is hard. Good procrastination wrestles with the big, hairy problems that take time. The type of problems you invest in today, and don&rsquo;t see the reward for another six or seven months.</p>

<hr />

<p>The customer is probably right. It might only be one day of development time to fix her problem.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not that easy.</p>

<p>As one of my fellow team members explained, &ldquo;time spent fixing things is time spent not building new things, and the future of the company depends on us building new things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Procrastination.</p>

<p>As I was writing my reply to the customer, I found myself with two choices. A dilemma.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I could explain to my team that we need to fix this for her, and we could fix it. Warm Fuzzies for everyone.</p></li>

<li><p>I could disappoint her and explain that our time is not best spent fixing this problem right now. Disappointment.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both choices involve procrastination.</p>

<p>The first choice is the bad type of procrastination. It&rsquo;s doing something less important. It&rsquo;s giving up our long-term goal for a reward - the Warm Fuzzies.</p>

<p>The second choice is good procrastination. It&rsquo;s working on something more important. It&rsquo;s committing to our long-term goal and deferring the reward for another day.</p>

<p>This is a dilemma we all face every day. You can choose the immediate gratification or the long-term goal.</p>

<hr />

<p>You&rsquo;re going to procrastinate.</p>

<p>Sometimes you choose do something less important and other times you choose do something more important. And sometimes, you choose to do nothing at all.</p>

<p>What will you choose today?</p>
