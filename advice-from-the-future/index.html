				<p><em>Over the last six months, I slogged through one of the largest projects of my career. Our team built the new <a href="https://help.highrisehq.com/">Highrise help site</a>, a glorified, 105 article, user manual for <a href="https://highrisehq.com/">our product</a>. We redesigned everything. Rewrote every article. Reorganized every topic and question. Below is the advice I wish I had before we got started.</em></p>
<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this advice from the future. Several support emails and text snippets from where you&rsquo;re standing now.</p>
<p>It might seem scary, but the next six months will be some of the toughest and most rewarding of your career. There is sure to be frustration and doubt.</p>
<p>Here is some guidance to help you along the way.</p>
<h2 id="start">Start</h2>
<p>Where do I start? If you find yourself asking this question over and over again, stop.</p>
<p>Just start. Anywhere. Cut it all in half.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to write a whole section in a day. Break it apart into smaller pieces. Try writing one article today. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll build momentum.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-temporary">Everything is Temporary</h2>
<p>In a matter of days, Highrise went from a product that hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a long time to having its own dedicated development and support team.</p>
<p>The product is changing fast.</p>
<p>A screenshot you take today will look different next week. It&rsquo;s easy to balk and not start documenting the product.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t decide whether to start writing documentation because it will all change soon, stop.</p>
<p>Take a breath. And make a decision. It&rsquo;s not life or death.</p>
<p>If you make the wrong decision, fix it as fast as you can and move on.</p>
<p>Everything is temporary. Accept it and get going.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-interruption">Embrace Interruption</h2>
<p>You work in customer support. The nature of your job breeds interruption.</p>
<p>A customer can email you at any time. You are managing multiple interactions at once. A team member can ask for help whenever.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fight it. You can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Make the time. Start to sacrifice and prioritize.</p>
<p>Schedule blocks of time to work on the help site. An hour on Monday. Two hours Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t abandon your customers, but if replies are slower for a few hours, everyone will survive.</p>
<p>Interruptions happen. Schedule around them and make the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h2 id="ask-for-help">Ask for help</h2>
<p>You cannot do it all alone. Stop waiting to ask for help. You&rsquo;re not perfect and you don&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re surrounded by people that can help you. You&rsquo;re lucky to be part of a <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3837-combine">team that is wicked smart and talented</a>. They want to help you.</p>
<p>Ask them. Don&rsquo;t feel guilty.</p>
<p>The help site is the most important resource for your customers. Your team needs to have a say in it, and be able to pitch in. Their perspective is invaluable.</p>
<p>You cannot do it all alone. Don&rsquo;t try. Ask for help early and often.</p>
<p>If you ask for help, your team will introduce a concept to you. It&rsquo;s DRY (don&rsquo;t repeat yourself).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t write the same HTML to create anchor links over and over again. Automate it. Don&rsquo;t know how to do it?</p>
<p>Ask for help. <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelDwan">Michael</a> can knock this out for you in minutes and he wants to help you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t write the same article twice. Yes, all the content you&rsquo;re writing is interrelated. You still don&rsquo;t have to repeat yourself.</p>
<p>You will write over 100 different articles. You can edit all of them on your own or check to make sure you&rsquo;re not repeating yourself. But that&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Ask for help. <a href="https://twitter.com/heywren">Wren</a> knows her stuff. She can whip the content into shape and make sure you&rsquo;re not repeating yourself. Wren can find gaps in the content and write new articles to help customers even more.</p>
<p>If you find yourself doing the same things over and over again, stop. Ask for help and see if you can eliminate some steps.</p>
<h2 id="play-the-long-game">Play the Long Game</h2>
<p>This project is not going to give you immediate results. Let go of expectations and the thirst for immediate satisfaction. It won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Anything worth doing takes time.</p>
<p>You will write for hours and feel like nothing has changed. You will believe you&rsquo;re done with the project several times, only to remember something else. <em>You&rsquo;re going to put all the videos in the wrong format and have to fix them.</em></p>
<p>This is where the real work happens. There are no shortcuts.</p>
<p>You cannot estimate how long this project is going to take. Accept it will be done when it&rsquo;s done. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to launch, but realize it&rsquo;s an investment.</p>
<p>An investment that needs to be made long before you see any sign that is paying off.</p>
<h2 id="keep-going">Keep Going</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel relief when the help site launches. Good. Celebrate it and congratulate your team.</p>
<p>But remember you&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be done. The help site you built isn&rsquo;t a filing cabinet that you&rsquo;re opening for your customers. Don&rsquo;t make them rummage around.</p>
<p>Make tweaks and pay attention to what your customers are looking for. Do everything you can to make it easy for people to find what they need.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stop there either.</p>
<p>You need to create more videos. Take new screenshots. Write new articles.</p>
<p>The help site is not a book that has been published. It&rsquo;s a living, breathing resource that needs to be watered every single day.</p>
<p>The help site is your best friend. Treat it that way. Take care of it and keep making it better.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Share your experience with others. There are people going through the same thing as you that need to hear this. Pay it forward.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Chris (from the future)</p>
<p><em>The new help site launched July 6. It was built by the Highrise team using a combination of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">Jekyll collections</a>, <a href="https://swiftype.com/">Swiftype</a>, and elbow grease. Notice a typo, have a thought about the help site, or other questions?</em></p>
<p><em>Let me know. I&rsquo;d love to hear it. I&rsquo;m <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/cjgallo">@cjgallo</a></strong> on Twitter.</em></p>
<p><em>PS - special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/natekontny">@natekontny</a> and the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/support-driven-chat/">Support Driven</a> community for help editing this post.</em></p>
