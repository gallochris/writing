				<p>When you come up with a new idea, how do you know if it&rsquo;s any <em>good</em>?</p>

<p>Good means different things to different people. A <em>good</em> idea to one person might be a terrible idea to someone else.</p>

<p>Instead of asking others if your idea is good or not, try asking yourself another question first.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Internet is a curious and strange place. The last few months, I&rsquo;ve noticed how Twitter has really changed. Twitter is losing the attention of a lot of people. Folks are giving that attention to other places.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Twitter is <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/18/twitter-will-die-if-it-doesnt-fix-its-noise-problem-says-early-investor-gary-vaynerchuk/">noisy</a>. There is a lot there that is expendable. Almost all.</p>

<p>But for me, there are still a few folks worth following and listening to.</p>

<p>What are these people doing differently?</p>

<p>Take Brad Panovich or <a href="https://twitter.com/wxbrad">@wxbrad</a>. He&rsquo;s a meteorologist in Charlotte, NC. Panovich is probably my top recommendation to follow on Twitter. That is, of course, if you&rsquo;re living in or around Charlotte.</p>

<p>He is relentless with information and forecasts. He works every day to share what to expect with the weather. Wondering if it&rsquo;s going to rain on a summer day? <a href="https://twitter.com/wxbrad/status/738127521284251648">Check with Panovich</a>.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s your personal weather expert. Twitter isn&rsquo;t his only outlet. He shares on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wxbradWCNC">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://wxbrad.com/">his website/blog</a>.</p>

<p>People trust Panovich. Why?</p>

<p>Because almost every single thing that he shares is useful.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/wxbrad">@wxbrad</a> TWC called for 80% all week for the weekend. We went with Brad, like always. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oakisland?src=hash">#oakisland</a> <a href="https://t.co/1rMVGigAZI">pic.twitter.com/1rMVGigAZI</a></p>&mdash; Joshua Helton (@j5hel) <a href="https://twitter.com/j5hel/status/737007560071491585">May 29, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The weather can impact your day in a lot of different ways, and Panovich gets that. He strives to be reliable and <a href="https://twitter.com/wxbrad/status/737840000633581569">accurate</a>. He responds to folks that ask him questions, and that builds trust.</p>

<p>It makes Panovich useful.</p>

<p>Another follow of mine that I enjoy is Spencer Hall or <a href="https://twitter.com/edsbs">@edsbs</a>. His tweets aren&rsquo;t exactly useful.</p>

<p>Take this one as an example.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">north carolinaaaaaa<br>come get your grades up<br>take your shirt off <br>twist it round your hand <br>take a test without a proctor</p>&mdash; SPENCER HALL (@edsbs) <a href="https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/524991281064607744">October 22, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not useful. And it&rsquo;s not even funny to some people. To me? That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>

<p>Hall&rsquo;s tweets sometimes make me audibly laugh, actually out loud, when in public. That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>

<p>Hall has other outlets too. A blog, <a href="http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/">Every Day Should be Saturday</a>. A <a href="https://soundcloud.com/spencer-hall-8">podcast</a>. He&rsquo;s on snapchat (@edsbsnappy) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/edsbs/">Instagram</a> too.</p>

<p>On Twitter, he has almost 100,000 followers. They&rsquo;re not following him because he&rsquo;s useful. You follow <a href="https://twitter.com/edsbs/">@edsbs</a> because almost everything that he shares is entertaining.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/735302406884360192">pure entertainment</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>If someone comes to me with an a project or something that needs to be done, the first question I’ll ask is, “Is this useful? How is it useful?”</p>

<p>And if it’s not useful, it better be entertaining.</p>

<p>And if it’s not useful or entertaining, there is only one other basket left. That’s useless.</p>

<p>To us, business is really not rocket science. It’s just do useful stuff. And avoid useless.</p>

<p>Manoj Bhargava, founder of 5-Hour Energy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bhargava described how he runs his company and the question he asks when someone has an idea or project they want to work on.</p>

<p><strong>Is this useful? If it&rsquo;s not useful, is it entertaining?</strong></p>

<p>2 baskets. Useful and entertaining. If it doesn&rsquo;t fall into one of those baskets, the idea is useless.</p>

<p>Stop wondering if your idea is any good.</p>

<p>Start asking yourself if your idea is useful or entertaining.</p>
