				<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Singing at the top of his lungs, windows down, a careless teenager approaches a stop sign. But he doesn&rsquo;t halt.</p>
<p>He slows down. And rolls right through it.</p>
<p>A police officer crosses the intersection and the two cars smack together like bumper boats. Except no one is on the water.</p>
<p>The cop accelerates forward and flips his car around in a complete 180. And the blue lights flash to pull the man over.</p>
<p>The dinged up passenger door of the cop car flies open. And the officer jumps out, fists clinched, ready to enforce the law.</p>
<p>The teenager awkwardly awaits feeling like he just got cut off at karaoke. Rushing as a linebacker would a quarterback, the police officer shouts - <em>&ldquo;what do you do at a stop sign?&quot;</em></p>
<p>The scared adolescent mumbles, <em>&ldquo;slow down.&quot;</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Do you follow directions? Or do you like coloring outside the lines?</p>
<p>Your day is filled with people trying to get you to do something. Whether it&rsquo;s your spouse asking you to take out the trash, your professor asking you to submit homework, or your boss asking for her report.</p>
<p>People demand action. Yet people fail to be specific.</p>
<p>You say please let us know if you have any questions. Instead of <a href="https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/best-answer-question/">asking a specific question</a>.</p>
<p>Buy our product. Why? It&rsquo;s better. Really? Why is it better? Specifically, what makes it better?</p>
<p>And the infamous, cable company. We will be at your house between noon and 5 p.m. That&rsquo;s terrible. Unreliable. And just plan careless.</p>
<p>A beautiful example of the difference between being specific and ambiguous comes from Simon Sinek. Watch this two minute and thirty-seven second clip as he explains the importance.</p>
<p>Without direction you&rsquo;ll end up no where.</p>

<p>Specific is clear. It builds trust. And it makes it personal.</p>
<p>This is the difference in being respected and ignored.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-youre-not-specific">What Happens when you&rsquo;re not specific</h2>
<p>General Motors is in a crisis. The bureaucratic company is recalling more cars than it&rsquo;s selling - that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t help that the company is not specific about its recalls. Over 2 million cars with the same defects were not recalled until <em>a decade</em> after the issue was found.</p>
<p>If the company was specific, the failed mass production of the cars would not have occurred in the first place. The recalls would of happened a decade earlier. And the company wouldn&rsquo;t be a walking embarrassment.</p>
<p>General Motors even went out of their way trying not to be specific - banning over 60 words that employees could not use. Watch as <a href="http://youtu.be/j6IZ2TroruU">John Oliver destroys</a> General Motors ridiculous actions.</p>
<p>Not being specific costs General Motors the trust of its customers.</p>
<h2 id="what-specific-can-do-for-you">What Specific Can do for you</h2>
<p>The restaurant serves one type of dish. It seats 10 people. The price of food starts at $300. And it&rsquo;s sold out every night.</p>
<p>Why? It&rsquo;s damn good sushi. And its chef, Jiro Ono, is specific.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get on the train at the same time and enter the same spot, everyday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jiro Ono, <a href="http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jiro Ono&rsquo;s path to success starts with simple actions. Humans are creatures of habit. Jiro proves this with his routine when he gets on the train every day.</p>
<p>This routine is proof of the power of being specific. Exact is specific. The same time. The same spot. Jiro&rsquo;s routine translates into how he cooks and runs his restaurant.</p>
<p>One apprentice made a dish hundreds of times over the span of months. And every time it failed to meet Jiro&rsquo;s specific standards. When the chef finally made the dish to his taste - he cried.</p>
<p>Specific is not easy. But it make all the difference in the world.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&ldquo;Slow down or stop?&quot;</em> The officer shouted back at the teenager. Again, the youngster claimed - <em>&ldquo;I slow down.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The cop reached for his belly club, and began swinging at the side mirror of the car knocking it out of whack.</p>
<p>The teenager screamed - <em>&ldquo;STOP!&quot;</em></p>
<p>And then cop asked a simple question. <em>&ldquo;Do you want me to stop or slow down?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Be specific.</p>
